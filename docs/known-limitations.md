# Known limitations

What does not work yet, verified against the compiler in this checkout. Each
entry is something a reader would otherwise hit and have to work out.

## Language

A tagged-enum variant carries at most one payload. `Circle(float64)` works;
`Pair(int32, int32)` does not parse. Wrap two values in a struct.

An array is one-dimensional. `int64[3][4]` does not parse; index a flat
`int64[12]` yourself.

A `T[N]` has its length in its type, so `N` has to be a constant. A length the
program computes belongs to a [slice](types.md), `T[]`.

Two types that store each other by value have no size, and that is reported:

```text
error[E0003]: 'A' and 'B' each store a value of the other, so neither has a
size. Hold one of them by pointer: 'B*'
```

Pointing at each other is fine, in a cycle of any length.

## Aggregate literals

An element of a literal initializing a local may be any expression the field
would accept in an assignment, computed values included. What is known while
compiling is laid out in the object file and copied in; what is not becomes a
store into that image at the element's own offset, so the two mix freely inside
one literal.

A `const` and a module-scope `var` are laid out before any code runs, so their
elements have to be constants: literals, other constants, `sizeof`, arithmetic
over those, `&function`, `&global`, `0`, string literals, and nested literals.
An element that is not reports where it sits:

```text
error[E0003]: a constant and a module-scope variable are laid out before the
program runs, so every element has to be known while compiling, and this one is
not. Make it a constant, or build the value in a function
```

A literal needs a target type, which it takes from the `var`, `const`,
assignment, or parameter it initializes. It cannot stand where no type says
what it is.

A closure cannot appear in one, because its environment is built at run time.
Writing a lambda where a `Fn` field is expected inside a literal reports a
mismatch against `fn(...)`.

Omitted struct fields and short array literals leave the rest zero. Extra
elements, unknown field names, and repeated field names are errors.

## What ran what

[Bare metal](bare-metal.md) carries one table of every machine claim, what
actually ran it, and where the evidence stops: AArch64 is proven on a
user-mode emulator and not on silicon, the GPU backends are proven well-formed
and not executed, and the 16-bit image is proven by its bytes and not by a
boot. Read that table before quoting any of them.

## Described calling conventions

A freestanding x86_64 or aarch64 target chooses its integer argument
registers. Nothing else about the convention is chosen: the float argument
registers, the callee-saved set, the indirect-return register, the stack
slot size and the frame layout are the emitter's, and a description that
tries to rewrite one is refused rather than ignored. A hosted target chooses
nothing at all, because the code on the other side of every `extern` call
never read the description.

A described convention is proven to reach the code by the emitted bytes
differing and the program still giving the right answer under an emulated
CPU. That is evidence about this compiler's output, not a claim that the
convention interoperates with anything else: a program built with one is
self-consistent and calls nothing built with another.

## Described machines

A described machine is one a program is written for and run on. It is not one
the compiler's backend can be aimed at: the register allocator does not
schedule around a described instruction, and a rewrite rule cannot map IR onto
one. Both would mean handing out the allocator and the emitters, which III.3
keeps private, and that is the next mountain rather than this one.

An operand occupies exactly one byte, so an immediate is 0 to 255 and a
program larger than that has to build wider values out of instructions.
An instruction takes at most three operands. A description is one `const` per
file. A branch names an index into `PROGRAM` rather than a byte offset, since
what a semantics function returns is the next instruction and not the next
address.

What an emulated instruction prints comes from the interpreter's model of the
write family, which records the bytes a call passed and caps how many calls it
keeps. A machine that prints thousands of lines exhausts that trace, and the
emulator reports it rather than pretending it printed them.

## Deadlines

The cost model comes from the target description, which carries `cost_op`,
`cost_load`, `cost_store`, `cost_branch`, `cost_multiply`,
`cost_multiply_float`, `cost_divide`, `cost_divide_float`, `cost_call` and
`cost_allocate`. A description that says nothing about costs keeps the
machine's own; one that says anything has to say all of it, since a model with
a hole in it would price an instruction at nothing. Those ten numbers are the
whole model: there is no per-opcode table, no distinction between the widths
of an add, and no way to say that two instructions issue together.

Costs are taken over the IR as lowered, before the optimizer runs. The number
is an upper bound on the work the program asked for, not a prediction of one
machine's cycles: no cache model, no branch predictor, no out-of-order
overlap. A deadline is a comparison against work, and it is exact about what
it compares.

A loop's trip count is read from its own bound: an induction variable with a
constant entry value, a constant step, and a limit that is either a constant
or a binding the function set once before the loop and never writes inside it.
A loop bounded by anything else is unbounded here and is refused unless
`--pgo` supplies a measured count. A global is one of those: another function
could write it, and the deadline pass does not ask the whole program whether
anyone does. A
recursive call is unbounded. A call through a pointer, a call with no body in
this program, and an `asm` block are unbounded.

Nested loops are costed innermost first, and each loop's extra cost is folded
into its header before an enclosing loop is measured. A loop whose body's
longest path depends on which iteration it is on is costed at its worst
iteration for every iteration.

## Schedules

A schedule's rows are literals, read before the program runs, so nothing in
one can be computed: no constant folded from another constant, no phase count
that depends on the target. A phase's entry is named as a string and has to be
a function of the same module; a function reached through an import is not
found by that name.

A dispatcher runs its thread's phases for as many frames as its argument
says, so the loop count comes from the program and not from the compiler. It
still does not start the other threads: the program hands `&FRAME_thread_1` to
whatever spawns threads, because which threading interface to use is a choice
the compiler does not make for anyone.

A phase with `joins: true` ends where the threads meet. A phase without one
does not, and two dispatchers running at once reach their own boundaries
independently. The counter behind a join is an `int32`, so a program runs at
most two billion frames divided by its thread count before it wraps. A join
spins rather than sleeping, which is right for a frame boundary two threads
reach at nearly the same time and wrong for one they reach minutes apart.

## Compile-time expansion

`comptime for` iterates two sequences: `typeof(T).fields`, and `TABLE.rows` for
a `const` holding an array literal. Anything else is refused by name:

```text
error[E0003]: 'comptime for' cannot iterate '.each'; the compile-time sequences
are '.fields' and '.rows'
```

A row of a struct answers to its own columns and to `.index`; a row of a plain
value is that value. Every column has to be a compile-time constant, which a
`const` guarantees.

Compile-time strings compare and nothing else. `==` and `!=` fold, which is
enough to check that two declarations agree by name. There is no
concatenation, ordering, length, or substring. `ident(...)` composes
declaration names under rules the compiler checks.

`ident(...)` composes a declaration's name, not a type. A generated type can be
named where it is used, and not from inside the iteration that generated it.

A `comptime for` reflects on the types the program wrote. Module-scope
expansion runs after those are registered and before the generated ones are, so
`typeof(GeneratedStruct).fields` reports an unknown type.

The binding cannot appear where a type goes. `f.type` answers `f.type.size` and
`f.type.kind`, and cannot be written as a parameter, return, or field type.

## Declared types

The prover behind `type Name = Base where predicate;` is deliberately cheap.
It follows integer ranges through constants, narrower types, `+`, `-`, `*`,
`/` and `%` by a positive constant, `&` with a non-negative mask, `>>` by a
constant, `for` ranges, and the comparisons in dominating `if` and `while`
conditions, including the negated condition after an `if` that returns. A
predicate that is not a comparison, such as `is_valid(value)`, is proven only
by a guard that repeats it on the same expression. Float predicates are proven
by constants and by guards, never by arithmetic. Nothing is proven across a
call: a function that checks its argument does not make the caller's value
proven.

A declared type refines a number, a bool, a char, a string, a pointer or a
slice. A struct, an enum or an array cannot be the base.

`mettle test` checks the range conjuncts of a proven conversion as it runs,
and `--check-proofs` does the same in a compiled program. A conjunct that
calls a function is not re-evaluated in either.

A rule sees a declared type in `p.types` with kind `declared` and its base
named, and does not see the predicate itself.

## Effects

A global written from two places is checked against the effects each writer
needs, and so is the object a global names: `g_jobs[i] = v` writes `g_jobs`,
and `g_buf[i] = v` writes the block `g_buf` points at, which the ledger calls
`*g_buf`. What is still not answered is the aliasing question itself. Two
different globals pointing at one allocation are two objects here, a pointer
passed in as a parameter is not traced back to whatever global it came from,
and an allocation reached only through a local is not named at all.

The check needs both writers to need an effect something `provides`. One
writer with no placed requirement means the program has not said where that
code runs, and nothing is claimed. Any effect appearing in both requirement
sets counts as the thing that orders them, because whoever provides it runs
them one at a time; the compiler does not ask whether that effect is a lock,
a phase or an initialised subsystem.

A function type with no `with` clause is open, so a call through it performs
`unknown`, and a function that `forbids` any effect cannot make one. Give the
type a `with` clause; `with none` is the closed empty set.

A call outside the program with no `with` clause is taken to perform `alloc`
and nothing else. It may in truth perform a user effect, and the compiler
cannot know; declare the extern `with` what it does.

A closed `with` clause on a function type includes the built-in effects, so a
function that prints does not fit `fn() -> void with Sim`; the type has to say
`with Sim, alloc`.

`main`, `@interrupt` and `@naked` functions, kernels, tests and the exports of
a `--shared` library are the entry points where requirements have to be
settled. A function whose address is taken and called from outside the
program through some other route is not seen as an entry point.

A method's clauses are checked like a function's. A lambda's effects are
inferred; a lambda cannot declare a clause.

The run-time check keeps one effect frame per function that declares a
clause, on a stack of at most 4096 frames per thread and 256 threads, in
`--check-effects` and `mettle test` only.

## Closures

A plain function value already sitting in a variable is not adapted to a
closure type. Take the address at the point you need it, `&twice`, which is
accepted at a declaration, an argument, a return, and an assignment.

## Borrow analysis

A borrow handed across a call boundary is not followed: the interior pointer
`&buf[4]` passed to a function is not related back to `buf` inside it. The
same gap sets the one limit on releasing an interpolated string: a callee that
stores its `string` parameter or hands it back is seen and nothing is
released, but a callee that passes the view's `chars` to an `extern` which
keeps the bytes is not, because nothing states what an `extern` does with a
pointer it is given. A `string` is a borrowed view, so a callee keeping one
past the call was already keeping a borrow.

A leak is reported for an allocation the function never frees. One the function
frees on some paths and not on the path an early `return` takes is not reported,
so a `defer free(p)` right after the allocation is still what makes the release
cover every exit.

Ownership itself is inferred per function and iterated over the call graph, so
a free, a store, and a fresh allocation do cross calls. Within a function the
analysis follows paths: a fact inside an `if`, a loop body, a `switch` arm or a
`match` arm is definite for that path, and what survives the join is what every
arm agreed on.

There is no ownership syntax, and the analysis rejects a program in exactly
three places: returning the address of a local, handing a task a pointer into
the frame that spawned it, and writing through a pointer already handed to a
task. Everything else it points at, it points at only when it can prove it.

A task is recognised by the shape of the call, meaning a function value
followed by a pointer argument. The function value may be written `&worker`,
held in a variable, or read out of a struct field or an array; what makes it
one is its type. What is not recognised is a spawn that takes the pointer
somewhere other than the argument straight after the entry point, and a
`rawptr` handed over with no function value anywhere in the call.

`--check-tasks` bounds the spawning thread's stack exactly on both platforms:
Windows keeps the base in the TEB, and on Linux the owned runtime records the
initial stack block for the first thread and the block it allocated for every
thread it created. A thread the runtime did not create and cannot see, started
by foreign code that then calls back into Mettle, has no recorded bound and
falls back to a thread stack's span above the current frame. See
[Borrow checker](borrow-checker.md).

## Null and bounds checks

Constant null dereferences are diagnosed while compiling. Run-time null checks
are emitted for dynamic dereferences in normal builds and dropped under
`--release`.

Fixed-size array indexing is checked at compile time for constant indices and
guarded at run time in normal builds, and those guards are dropped under
`--release`. Use [`--safe`](memory-safety.md) to keep them, including under
`--release`.

Pointer indexing is never bounds-checked, because the compiler does not know
the pointee's extent. A slice does carry one, so `T[]` indexing is checked
against the length the value holds, under the same rule: guarded in normal
builds, dropped under `--release`, kept under `--safe`. Pointers arriving from
C or from inline assembly can be invalid in ways nothing can prove.

## Device address spaces and alignment

A device pointer's space is a fact the type carries, and the compiler moves it
along assignments, index arithmetic and address-of. It does not move it through
an integer: a pointer cast to `int64` and back arrives generic, and the space
has to be written again on the way out.

An `align(N)` claim is proven from the pointer it was built on and the offset
added to it. An offset held in a mutable local carries no proof of its own, so
either write the arithmetic where the claim is, or give the local a declared
type whose predicate says the divisor.

Adjacent loads widen into one `ld.global.v2`/`ld.global.v4` only inside a
single block and only through a pointer whose declared alignment covers the
whole access. Stores are never widened.

A plain `T*` that may hold a workgroup or private address is made generic
where that address enters it. A plain pointer read back from memory is not
followed: it is taken to hold a global address. A workgroup pointer stored to
memory and loaded again must be loaded as `T shared*`.

## Inline PTX and the GPU intrinsics

An `asm` block's bindings are read or written according to where they sit in
each PTX instruction: in the first operand they are written (and also read
when the instruction is predicated, is `wgmma`, or the block has a label or a
branch). Everywhere else, and in the first operand of a memory address or of
`st`, `red`, `bar`, `bra`, `call`, `cp`, `stmatrix`, `fence` and the few
others with no destination, they are read. An instruction that writes a
register outside its first operand does not fit this rule: bind such a value
through a `mov` into the first operand of its own instruction.

A device function whose `asm` defines a label is not inlined, and a loop
holding such a block must not be unrolled with `@unroll`: each copy would
define the label again.

The intrinsics' types are fixed: `h2f` takes and `f2h` returns an `int32`
holding the half's bits. A declaration that spelled them with `uint16` is now
an error that prints the expected signature; drop the declaration and cast
the value where it meets a `uint16`.

`ncu`'s command-line printer fails with "bad conversion" under a locale whose
decimal separator is a comma. Collecting with `-o` works; read the report with
Nsight Compute's Python interface (see [GPU offload](gpu.md)).

## Running a kernel's grid on the CPU

`mettle test` runs a dispatched grid in the compiler's interpreter, one block
at a time and one barrier phase at a time. A barrier inside a device helper is
refused rather than counted: the runner stops a work item in the kernel's own
frame, and a helper's frame is not one it can resume. Move the barrier into the
kernel.

The grid is capped at 65536 work items. Beyond that the run reports the cap
rather than trying.

Work items inside one phase run one after another, so a kernel whose work items
race each other inside a phase gets one interleaving out of the run and not a
verdict on the others.

## Device types on real hardware

The four device type items -- address spaces and alignment in the pointer type,
layouts as types, uniformity as a declared type, and the collective effects --
are proven by the compiler's own tests, by the grid runner in
`mettle test`, and by `ptxas` and `nvdisasm` on the emitted module, and have
not been executed on a GB10.

## Layouts as types

A view whose extents are in its type is rank 2. `T[E0, E1, E2]` parses and
resolves, but only the two-dimensional form has element addressing and a bank
proof.

An index into one is proven or refused; there is no run-time check to fall back
on. An index the compiler cannot bound has to be given a declared type, tested,
or written as a constant.

The fragment layouts name what an MMA takes its operands in. They are refused
as element addresses, and nothing yet consumes them: `tensor_mma` still takes
its operands as pointers and leading dimensions.

`layout_copy` moves elements one at a time. It is the staged copy, not a
shuffle: no subgroup exchange is generated for a layout change.

## Uniformity and the group effects

A value is uniform when the compiler can follow every input to it. It follows
arithmetic, casts, direct calls and a local's writes; it does not follow a
value through memory, so a `constant` table read at a uniform index is refused
even though it is in fact the same in every work item.

`Warp` and `Block` reach a call site through the branches and loops that
enclose it syntactically. A helper that is itself called from both a uniform
and a divergent site is judged once, at the divergent one.

An effect clause has to sit on the same line as the signature it follows. A
signature wrapped across lines with `requires` on the next one is a syntax
error.

## Vectorization

Reductions over `^`, `&`, and `|` have no kernel and are reported as serial.

Float elements have no select kernel, so a clamp over `float32` or `float64`
stays scalar. The same clamp over `int32` vectorizes.

A reduction over a byte array needs a 64-bit accumulator. An `int32`
accumulator summing bytes is reported rather than vectorized.

Multi-store fission over regions it cannot prove distinct keeps the loop and
puts a run-time overlap test in front of the kernels, so the function holds
both versions and is that much larger. The test itself is a handful of
compares before the loop, not per iteration.

Depth is bounded by registers. An int32 map has six ymm registers for its
expression, and a deeper one falls back.

`--explain` names the reason for every loop it leaves alone, and
`mettle explain <code>` expands any of them.

## Struct ABI

Struct-by-value arguments and returns work in both directions on both
platforms, under the Microsoft x64 rule on Windows and System V's eightbyte
classification on Linux. See
[C interoperability](c-interop.md).

## Deferred calls

A deferred direct call, `defer f(args)`, captures its argument values at the
defer point and replays them at scope exit.

A deferred method call, `defer obj.m(...)`, and a deferred call through a
function pointer re-evaluate their operands at scope exit. Snapshot into a
local first when you need the value from the defer point.

`errdefer` is function-only and convention-based: any non-zero explicit return
is treated as an error.

## Platform

Shared libraries are ELF `.so` and Windows DLL. On Windows `--build --shared`
emits a DLL whose exports are the user globals (`export fn/var`; compiler-owned
`mettle_*` tables stay private) with no entry point; `-l`, `--export-dynamic`,
`--rpath` and `--dynamic-linker` stay ELF-only, and a DLL takes its libraries
through `--link-arg`. A DLL must load at its preferred base (no `.reloc` is
emitted yet) and ships no import library. A shared object Mettle emits cannot
reference imported data, and holds no
thread-local storage: its build of the runtime keeps `errno` per process. See
[Shared libraries](shared-libraries.md).

The Windows internal linker takes its libraries through `--link-arg`, not
through `-l`.

`std/ui`, the Win32 window and control helpers, is Windows-only. It has no
Linux counterpart.

External Tracy needs a C++ runtime, so `--tracy` fails under the owned runtime
rule. `--profile-runtime` is the built-in alternative.

`--musl` is rejected, because linking musl would break the owned-runtime rule.

## Narrow targets

The 16- and 32-bit targets compute in one register's worth of value. A value
wider than a word -- `int32` in 16-bit code, `int64` or a float in either -- is
a compile error naming the declaration. A struct or an array is a frame region
reached by address, so both work; strings do not travel through these targets
at all. Pointers are near.

Neither target has an object format that carries its relocations, so
`--emit-flat` is their only product; asking for an object or an executable is
an error rather than a file whose code is the wrong width for its header.

Real mode pushes no error code, so a 16-bit `@interrupt` handler takes no
parameters or the interrupt frame alone. `bits 16` and `bits 32` are allowed
inside a `@naked` function, which is the only place the compiler contributes no
bytes of its own.

A freestanding target has no runtime, so it emits no runtime checks and refuses
`--safe`. `--build` needs a linker and a runtime belonging to the machine being
built for, so it is refused for a foreign or freestanding target.
Cross-compiling means emitting the object here and linking it there.

## Compiler

An expression may nest 4096 levels deep, and blocks may nest 4096 deep. Past
either the compiler reports it:

```text
error[E0002]: Expression nests more than 4096 levels deep
```

Nesting is what counts, not length: `a + b + c + ...` folds in a loop and costs
one level however long it runs. The ceiling exists because each level is a
frame in the recursive descent and in every pass that walks the tree
afterwards, and without it deep enough input exhausted the stack and killed the
process with no diagnostic. It sits an order of magnitude below where that
happened.

Unreachable-code analysis is block-local and conservative. Some dead paths in
complex control flow are not diagnosed.

A `@rule` over a `Trace` reads events, and there are two ways to get them:
`mettle test` runs the program in the compile-time interpreter, and
`--record-trace` has a compiled process write down what it did for
`mettle check-trace` to read back. The rule is not linked into the program and
does not run inside it; what ships is the recording, and the verdict is
reached afterwards on a machine that has the compiler.

A recording carries entering a function, an allocation, a free, taking a lock
and releasing one, and nothing else. There is no argument value, no return
value and no timing. Events stop after `METTLE_TRACE_MAX` of them (200000 by
default) and the file ends with a line saying how many were dropped. The
buffer is flushed where `main` returns, so a process that leaves through
`exit`, a fault or a kill writes only the buffers that had already filled.

The recorder is not thread-aware: two threads write into one buffer with
nothing ordering them, so a trace from a program that records on more than one
thread is not one this reads back with confidence.

`--check-overflow` traps on a signed `+`, `-` or `*` that leaves its type,
and a declared range that bounds the operands tightly enough deletes the
check, which `--explain` reports under **proven by type**. Unsigned
arithmetic is not checked: wrapping is what an unsigned type is reached for in
a hash or a checksum. Nothing else is checked either, so a cast that narrows,
a shift past the width and a divide by a variable zero are what they were.
Without the flag, signed arithmetic wraps, which is the language's own rule
and not an omission.

Two pointers cannot be declared disjoint, and they are not going to be: a
declaration the compiler acts on and cannot check is a proof, annotated, which
I.4 refuses. What the compiler does instead is emit a test. Where multi-store
fission cannot prove the regions distinct, the loop is kept and a run-time
overlap test is put in front of the kernels; where it can, no test is emitted
at all. So a proof deletes a test rather than deciding whether the
optimization happens.

The test is only in the multi-store fission path, which is the one place a
vectorizer here needed the regions to be distinct. It compares addresses with
a signed compare, which is exact for every address a user-space program on
either supported platform can hold. A pair of regions where one name is
reached from two kernels is refused rather than tested, because two kernels
over one region are not the loop that interleaved them.

A float accumulator carries a declared bound only where the compiler bounded
the loop's trip count: a counter with a constant initialiser, a constant step,
and a limit that is either a constant or a binding whose declared type carries
a maximum. `for i in 0..n` where `n: Count` and `Count` is
`int64 where value <= 64` runs at most 64 times, and the accumulator carries a
bound that follows. A length with no declared bound gives the accumulator
none, so a declared type on it is refused.

The interpreter watches every declared-`@pure` and every inferred read-only
frame under `mettle test` and traps on a write inside one, but that watch can
only confirm the static proof: purity is proven by refusing every operation
that could write, so no Mettle program can pass the check and then write, and
the watch is proven live by `--check-purity-fault`, which corrupts the analysis
on purpose so the watch has something real to catch.
