# The libmtlc type system

The backend owns its own type descriptor, `MtlcType` (in
[`include/mtlc/type.h`](../../include/mtlc/type.h)). Frontends translate their
types into it at the IR boundary; the code generators read nothing else. It is
a plain value struct with no methods and no hierarchy: kind, layout, and
composition pointers.

## Kinds

```c
typedef enum {
  MTLC_TYPE_INT8,  MTLC_TYPE_INT16,  MTLC_TYPE_INT32,  MTLC_TYPE_INT64,
  MTLC_TYPE_UINT8, MTLC_TYPE_UINT16, MTLC_TYPE_UINT32, MTLC_TYPE_UINT64,
  MTLC_TYPE_BOOL,
  MTLC_TYPE_FLOAT32, MTLC_TYPE_FLOAT64,
  MTLC_TYPE_STRING,
  MTLC_TYPE_FUNCTION_POINTER,
  MTLC_TYPE_POINTER, MTLC_TYPE_ARRAY,
  MTLC_TYPE_STRUCT, MTLC_TYPE_ENUM, MTLC_TYPE_TAGGED_ENUM,
  MTLC_TYPE_VOID
} MtlcTypeKind;
```

The scalar kinds, with the layout the canonical constructors give them and the
signedness the instruction selectors assume:

| Kind | Size | Align | Class |
|---|---|---|---|
| `INT8` / `INT16` / `INT32` / `INT64` | 1/2/4/8 | = size | signed integer |
| `UINT8` / `UINT16` / `UINT32` / `UINT64` | 1/2/4/8 | = size | unsigned integer |
| `BOOL` | 1 | 1 | unsigned integer (0/1) |
| `FLOAT32` / `FLOAT64` | 4/8 | = size | IEEE-754 binary32/64 |
| `POINTER` / `FUNCTION_POINTER` | 8 | 8 | unsigned address |
| `STRING` | 8 | 8 | pointer-sized handle (see caveat below) |
| `VOID` | 0 | 1 | only as a return type |

Signedness matters: it selects signed vs unsigned division, remainder,
comparison, and right-shift, and whether a narrow load sign- or zero-extends.
`mtlc_type_is_unsigned` reports the classification the backend uses.

The `STRING` caveat. `MTLC_TYPE_STRING` is the Mettle frontend's string
type: an 8-byte handle whose heap layout and helper kernels are defined by that
frontend's lowering. A foreign frontend should model its strings explicitly
(for example `mtlc_type_pointer(mtlc_type_scalar(MTLC_TYPE_UINT8))` for a
C-style byte pointer) rather than borrowing this kind.

## The descriptor

```c
typedef struct MtlcType {
  MtlcTypeKind kind;
  const char *name;            /* canonical, parseable name; may be NULL */
  size_t size, alignment;      /* bytes */
  MtlcAddressSpace address_space; /* POINTER only */

  struct MtlcType *base_type;  /* pointee (POINTER) / element (ARRAY) */
  size_t array_size;           /* element count (ARRAY) */

  /* FUNCTION_POINTER signature */
  struct MtlcType **fn_param_types;
  size_t fn_param_count;
  struct MtlcType *fn_return_type;
  struct MtlcType *closure_env; /* synthesized capture record, else NULL */

  /* STRUCT layout */
  const char **field_names;
  struct MtlcType **field_types;
  size_t *field_offsets;
  size_t field_count;

  /* TAGGED_ENUM layout */
  const char **tagged_variant_names;
  int *tagged_variant_tags;
  struct MtlcType **tagged_variant_payloads;
  size_t tagged_variant_count;
  size_t tagged_data_offset, tagged_data_size;
} MtlcType;
```

Descriptors are immutable after construction as far as the backend is
concerned; nothing in libmtlc writes to one.

## Canonical constructors and the immortality contract

Everything in the API that accepts a `const MtlcType *` borrows it, and the
module's type registry stores the pointer by reference and never frees it.
So every descriptor you hand the backend must outlive every module that saw it.
The canonical constructors make that trivial:

```c
const MtlcType *mtlc_type_scalar(MtlcTypeKind kind);
const MtlcType *mtlc_type_pointer(const MtlcType *base);
const MtlcType *mtlc_type_pointer_in(const MtlcType *base,
                                     MtlcAddressSpace address_space);
const MtlcType *mtlc_type_array(const MtlcType *element, size_t count);
const MtlcType *mtlc_type_struct(const char *name,
                                 const char *const *field_names,
                                 const MtlcType *const *field_types,
                                 size_t field_count);
const MtlcType *mtlc_type_function_pointer(const MtlcType *return_type,
                                           const MtlcType *const *param_types,
                                           size_t param_count);
```

- `mtlc_type_scalar` returns a static singleton per scalar kind: immortal,
  shared, correctly sized and named (`"int64"`, `"float32"`, ...). It returns
  NULL for the kinds that carry their own layout, which the constructors below
  build instead (`TAGGED_ENUM` and `ENUM` remain hand-built).
- `mtlc_type_pointer` creates a generic pointer. `mtlc_type_pointer_in` creates
  a pointer in generic, global, workgroup, constant, or private device memory.
  Pointer descriptors intern by `(base, address_space)`: the first request
  allocates a descriptor that lives for the rest of the process, and every
  later identical request returns the same pointer. Chains compose
  (`mtlc_type_pointer(mtlc_type_pointer(i64))` is `int64**`). The intern cache
  is thread-local, upholding the backend's no-shared-mutable-globals rule;
  descriptors created on different threads for the same pointee are distinct
  pointers but interchangeable in meaning.

- `mtlc_type_array` interns by `(element, count)` and takes its alignment from
  the element. Its canonical name is `"<element>[<count>]"`.
- `mtlc_type_struct` computes the layout under the standard C rule: each field
  goes at the next offset satisfying its own alignment, the struct's alignment
  is the widest field's, and the size rounds up to that alignment. Structs
  intern by name, which is what keeps the registry unambiguous: the same
  declaration returns the same descriptor, and a redeclaration with a different
  layout returns NULL instead of silently shadowing the first.
- `mtlc_type_function_pointer` interns by signature, with the canonical name
  `"ret(*)(p0,p1)"`.

Query the computed layout with `mtlc_type_field_count`,
`mtlc_type_field_offset`, and `mtlc_type_field_index` (by name). The last two
return `(size_t)-1` when the type is not a struct or the field does not exist.

Call them at any time, in any order, from the thread doing that compilation,
and never free the results.

## Names must parse

The IR carries types by name in two places: a local declaration and a cast
record the type's name, and function signatures record parameter/return type
names. Code generators resolve those names through the module type registry.
The builder registers every descriptor it saw under `type->name` (falling back
to the kind name), so:

- canonical scalars register as `"int8"` ... `"void"`;
- generic pointers register as `"<base>*"` (`"int64*"`, `"float32**"`);
  explicitly spaced pointers include the space in their canonical name (for
  example `"global:float32*"`) so distinct spaces cannot collide;
- arrays register as `"<element>[<count>]"`, structs under the name given to
  `mtlc_type_struct`, and function pointers as `"ret(*)(p0,p1)"`;
- a hand-built descriptor must have a unique, stable `name`, or two
  different structs would collide under the fallback kind name. Using
  `mtlc_type_struct` makes this automatic, since it interns by name and rejects
  a conflicting reuse.

## Aggregates

Prefer `mtlc_type_array` and `mtlc_type_struct`: they compute the layout, intern
the descriptor, and register a parseable name. `TAGGED_ENUM` and `ENUM` still
have to be built by filling the struct yourself: allocate it (statically, or
from an arena that outlives the module), set `kind`, `name`, `size`,
`alignment`, and the layout arrays, and use it wherever a type is accepted.

The x86-64 code generator honors the layout: field offsets for member access
lower as base-plus-offset, and aggregate copies go by size. Reach a struct's
fields through a pointer with `mtlc_field_address`, `mtlc_load_field`, and
`mtlc_store_field` ([build.h](api.md#buildh)), which turn a field index into the
offset arithmetic for you:

```c
const char *names[] = {"x", "y"};
const MtlcType *types[] = {i32, i32};
const MtlcType *point = mtlc_type_struct("Point", names, types, 2);
const MtlcType *ppoint = mtlc_type_pointer(point);

mtlc_store_field(fn, p, ppoint, mtlc_type_field_index(point, "y"),
                 mtlc_const_int(fn, i32, 7));
```

Two limitations remain:

1. No aggregate locals through `mtlc_local`: a struct value lives behind a
   pointer (a `malloc` result, or `mtlc_address_of` on storage you declared),
   and field access is the pointer arithmetic above, which is what it compiles
   to anyway.
2. The GPU and ARM64 emitters do not accept aggregates at all (see the
   [per-target table](ir.md#what-each-consumer-requires)).

## Classification queries

```c
int mtlc_type_is_integer(const MtlcType *t);   /* INT8..UINT64, BOOL        */
int mtlc_type_is_unsigned(const MtlcType *t);  /* UINT*, BOOL, pointers     */
int mtlc_type_is_float(const MtlcType *t);     /* FLOAT32, FLOAT64          */
int mtlc_type_is_aggregate(const MtlcType *t); /* STRUCT, TAGGED_ENUM, ARRAY */
size_t mtlc_type_size(const MtlcType *t);      /* 0 for NULL                */
size_t mtlc_type_alignment(const MtlcType *t); /* 0 for NULL                */
const char *mtlc_type_kind_name(MtlcTypeKind kind);
```

These are the same predicates the code generators call; if you need to make a
layout or signedness decision in your frontend, deciding it the way the backend
will is one call away.
