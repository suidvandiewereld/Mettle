# GPU offload

libmtlc has three GPU code generators, NVIDIA PTX, SPIR-V (OpenCL) and Metal
Shading Language for Apple GPUs, all emitted from the same IR with no `nvcc`,
no `cudart`, and no LLVM. Through the reference frontend, kernels are written
in Mettle, compiled to a `.ptx` module with `--emit-ptx` (a `.spv` module with
`--emit-spirv`, a `.metal` file with `--emit-metal`), and, for the
CUDA path, launched from a normal Mettle host program via the
[`std/gpu`](standard-library.md#stdgpu) bindings and the `dispatch` statement.
(A frontend driving libmtlc directly reaches the same generators through
`mtlc_emit`; see [Writing a frontend for libmtlc](embedding.md).)

The model is two-stage and explicit: kernels live in their own file, the
host manages device memory itself, and `dispatch` only performs the launch. This
mirrors how real GPU code manages persistent VRAM.

## Writing a kernel

A kernel file is compiled with `mettle --emit-ptx`. Use the `kernel` keyword for
GPU entry points (it parses like `fn` and is emitted as a PTX `.entry`):

```mettle
kernel vadd(a: float32*, b: float32*, c: float32*, n: int32) {
  var i: int32 = block.x * block_dim.x + thread.x;
  if (i < n) {
    c[i] = a[i] + b[i];
  }
}
```

`kernel(block = N)` fixes the block size (PTX `.reqntid`). N is any integer the
compiler knows, so a family of kernels generated from a table takes it from the
row. `tensor_mma`'s `m:`, `n:` and `k:`, `async_copy_workgroup`'s element count
and `transaction:`, and `async_copy_wait`'s group count take compile-time
integers the same way. Inside a kernel an integer `const` and arithmetic on
literals fold while compiling, so a layout computed from a row's columns costs
nothing at run time:

```mettle
comptime for t in TILES.rows {
  kernel(block = t.warps * 32) ident("gemm_", t.name)(a: uint16*, b: uint16*,
                                                      d: float32*) {
    comptime for c in 0..t.chunks {
      tensor_mma(a + c * 64, b + c * 64, d, d, m: 16, n: 32, k: 64, ...);
    }
  }
}
```

### Index built-ins

Inside `--emit-ptx` compiles, the GPU thread/block indices are built-in member
expressions that mirror CUDA:

| Mettle        | CUDA          | PTX special register |
|---------------|---------------|----------------------|
| `thread.x`    | `threadIdx.x` | `%tid.x`             |
| `block.x`     | `blockIdx.x`  | `%ctaid.x`           |
| `block_dim.x` | `blockDim.x`  | `%ntid.x`            |
| `grid_dim.x`  | `gridDim.x`   | `%nctaid.x`          |

`.x`, `.y`, and `.z` are all available. The canonical global-thread index is:

```mettle
var i: int32 = block.x * block_dim.x + thread.x;
```

These built-ins are only active during GPU-module compiles, so member access on
an ordinary struct named `block` in a CPU program is unaffected.

### Supported kernel constructs

Kernels use the same syntax as CPU code: arithmetic, comparisons, `if`/`while`,
pointer indexing, casts, and the built-in GPU intrinsics listed below
(`sqrtf` lowers to `sqrt.rn`, `expf` to `ex2.approx`, and so on). The PTX
backend is validated structurally by round-tripping emitted PTX through
`ptxas`; a CUDA Driver differential suite executes correctness and sanitizer
cases on development hardware and has a stricter native GB10 mode. See the
[GPU architecture and acceptance contract](gpu-architecture.md).

### Built-in intrinsics

Device code calls these without declaring them. A call counts as device code
in a file compiled with `--emit-ptx` or `--emit-spirv`, and in any function of
a module that has a kernel. An `extern fn` with one of these names must
declare exactly the signature below (parameter names do not matter), so an
existing declaration keeps compiling and a wrong one is an error that prints
the expected signature.

| Group | Intrinsics |
|---|---|
| thread geometry | `gpu_tid_x/y/z()`, `gpu_ntid_x/y/z()`, `gpu_ctaid_x/y/z()`, `gpu_nctaid_x/y/z()`, each `-> int32` |
| barrier | `gpu_barrier()` |
| f32 math | `sqrtf`, `rsqrtf`, `fabsf`, `sinf`, `cosf`, `logf`, `expf`: `(x: float32) -> float32` |
| fp16 | `h2f(bits: int32) -> float32`, `f2h(x: float32) -> int32` |
| packed fp16 | `h2f_lo(p: uint32) -> float32`, `h2f_hi(p: uint32) -> float32`, `f2h2(lo: float32, hi: float32) -> uint32`, `hadd2(a: uint32, b: uint32) -> uint32`, `hmul2(a: uint32, b: uint32) -> uint32`, `hfma2(a: uint32, b: uint32, c: uint32) -> uint32` |
| bf16 | `bf2f(bits: uint32) -> float32`, `f2bf(x: float32) -> uint32` |
| bit casts | `f32_from_bits(bits: uint32) -> float32`, `bits_from_f32(x: float32) -> uint32` |
| integer dot | `dp4a_u32`, `dp2a_lo_u32`, `dp2a_hi_u32`: `(a: uint32, b: uint32, c: uint32) -> uint32`; `dp4a_s32`, `dp2a_lo_s32`, `dp2a_hi_s32`: `(a: int32, b: int32, c: int32) -> int32` |
| byte permute | `prmt_b32(a: uint32, b: uint32, sel: uint32) -> uint32` |
| 128-bit access | `load4_f32(src: float32*, dst: float32*)`, `load4_u32(src: uint32*, dst: uint32*)`, `store4_f32(dst: float32*, src: float32*)`, `store4_u32(dst: uint32*, src: uint32*)` |
| transaction barriers | `mbarrier_init(bar: uint64 shared*, count: uint32)`, `mbarrier_arrive_expect_tx(bar: uint64 shared*, bytes: uint32)`, `mbarrier_wait_parity(bar: uint64 shared*, parity: uint32)`, `fence_mbarrier_init()`, `fence_proxy_async()` |
| tensor maps | `tma_load_2d(dst: uint8 shared*, map: uint8*, c0: int32, c1: int32, bar: uint64 shared*)`, `tensormap_acquire(map: uint8*)` |
| printing | `gpu_print(fmt: cstring)`, `gpu_print_i32(fmt: cstring, v: int32)`, `gpu_print_f32(fmt: cstring, v: float32)`, `gpu_print_2i32(fmt: cstring, a: int32, b: int32)`, `gpu_assert(cond: int32)` |
| subgroup, typed | `subgroup_local_id()`, `subgroup_size()` `-> uint32`; `subgroup_broadcast_u32`, `subgroup_shuffle_u32`: `(value: uint32, lane: uint32) -> uint32`; the `_f32` forms take and return `float32` with a `uint32` lane; `subgroup_reduce_{add,min,max}_u32`, `subgroup_scan_{inclusive,exclusive}_add_u32`: `(value: uint32) -> uint32`, and the `_f32` forms on `float32`; `subgroup_ballot_word(predicate: bool, word: uint32) -> uint32`; `subgroup_any`, `subgroup_all`: `(predicate: bool) -> bool` |

The generic subgroup built-ins (`subgroup_reduce_add` and the rest) and the
scoped atomics have their own syntax, described in their sections.

An ordinary function called by a kernel is emitted as a non-entry device helper
in both PTX and SPIR-V. Reachability is transitive and unrelated host functions
are omitted; `kernel` remains the only launch-entry marker. Direct calls with
scalar, pointer, or record parameters/results are supported. Recursion, indirect
calls, external calls, host launches from device code, and calling a kernel as a
normal function are rejected by a shared IR call-graph verifier, so the rule is
the same for every frontend and GPU backend.

### Inline PTX

An `asm { ... }` block in device code is emitted into the PTX as written,
for the instructions Mettle has no construct for -- `mma.sync` fragments held
in registers, `ldmatrix`, `cvt.rn.f16x2.f32`. Each `{name}` binds the scalar
local or parameter `name`.

The block is an ordinary instruction to the optimizer. Its bindings are
explicit operands: a binding the PTX reads is an input, and one it writes gets
a new definition right after the block. A binding is written when it sits in
an instruction's first operand (the destination), unless that operand is an
address (`[...]`) or the opcode has no destination (`st`, `red`, `bar`, `bra`,
`cp`, `stmatrix`, `fence`, ...). A predicated (`@p`) write, a `wgmma`
accumulator, and any write in a block with a label or a branch also count as a
read, since the old value can survive. Everything else in the function is
optimized as if the block were any other instruction: values are shared and
propagated across it, and a device function containing asm can be inlined
unless the asm defines a label.

In the PTX, a binding that is only read is the register already holding its
value, and one that is only written is a fresh register copied to the local
afterwards. A binding that is read and written, such as an `mma.sync`
accumulator, is copied into a register of its own before the block and back
after it, because the PTX names one register for both. ptxas coalesces these
copies: a loop whose body is asm uses the registers of the same loop written
in Mettle.

```mettle
// s0..s3, a0..a3 and b0..b1 declared as scalars: the accumulator, the
// A fragment and the B fragment of one m16n8k16 tile.
asm {
  mma.sync.aligned.m16n8k16.row.col.f32.f16.f16.f32 {{s0}, {s1}, {s2}, {s3}}, {{a0}, {a1}, {a2}, {a3}}, {{b0}, {b1}}, {{s0}, {s1}, {s2}, {s3}};
}
```

A brace that does not enclose a bare name is PTX's own, as in the vector
operands above or a `{ .reg .pred p; ... }` scope. The block ends at its
matching brace, counted with `;` starting a comment to the end of the line
(the x86 rule), so a PTX scope closes on a line of its own. A name that is not
a register-held scalar -- an array, a record, a local whose address is taken,
or nothing at all -- is an error naming it. The target, the register classes
and every instruction's validity are ptxas's to check.

### Records

Structs, fixed arrays, and arrays of structs work in device code the way they do
on the host:

```mettle
struct Ray { origin: Vec3; direction: Vec3; depth: int32; }

@noinline fn advance(ray: Ray*, t: float32) -> Vec3 { /* ... */ }

kernel trace(hits: float32*, scene: Params) {
  var ray: Ray;
  var stack: Ray[8];
  var top: int32 = 0;
  /* ... */
  var point: Vec3 = advance(&stack[top], 0.5);
}
```

A record local, a record field, a runtime-indexed array of records, taking a
record's address, passing one to a helper by value or by pointer, returning one,
and assigning one whole are all available. A record is also a kernel parameter
type, which is how a launch passes one settings block in place of eleven
scalars.

Under `-O` the shared optimizer splits a record whose fields are only ever read
and written at constant offsets into separate scalars, so the common case costs
no memory at all. A record it cannot split keeps per-thread storage: PTX uses
`.local` and SPIR-V a Function-storage byte array. An address that leaves the
function, as a call argument or stored into memory, is converted to a generic
address first, so a helper never reads a local address as if it were global.

A record parameter crosses the launch boundary as its own bytes, the same shape
CUDA gives a struct argument, so `--emit-kernel-decls` writes the record
declarations alongside the `extern kernel` lines and the generated file stays
self-contained. Every field has to mean the same thing on both sides, so a
record reaching a kernel holds scalars, pointers, fixed arrays, and nested
records; a string, a closure, or a function pointer is refused at the source.

The current OpenCL 2.0 SPIR-V profile has record locals, record arrays, and
pointers to records. It has no by-value record call ABI, and says so rather than
passing the wrong thing.

### Decorators on device code

[Function decorators](declarations.md#decorators) apply to device
helpers under `-O`, and they buy more here than on the host. A helper left out
of line becomes a PTX `.func` reached by `call.uni`: the call ABI's parameter
space, plus a register allocation that stops at the call boundary, paid once
per work item.

```mettle
@inline fn scale(alpha: float32, x: float32) -> float32 { return alpha * x; }

@noinline fn table_lookup(table: float32*, k: int32) -> float32 { /* ... */ }
```

`@inline` absorbs the helper into every kernel that calls it; `@inline!` fails
the build at any call site that survives, the same contract it carries on the
host; and `@noinline` is how a helper stays a real device call. Recursion and
indirect calls are already rejected in device code, so what the inliner sees is
a plain DAG of direct calls.

A loop-invariant call is hoisted out of a kernel's loop where the compiler
proves the callee writes nothing and cannot fault. That proof is inferred,
so `@pure` changes nothing about the hoist; it is a contract that fails the
build if the helper ever starts writing.

A frontend driving libmtlc directly reaches all four through
`mtlc_fn_set_inline`, `mtlc_fn_set_inline_required`, `mtlc_fn_set_noinline`,
and `mtlc_fn_set_pure`.

### Address spaces and alignment in the pointer type

A device pointer says where its data lives, and the type carries it:

```mettle
kernel scale(rows: float32 global align(16)*,
             table: float32 constant*,
             out: float32 global*, width: int32) {
  workgroup var tile: float32[64];
  /* ... */
}
```

`global`, `shared`, `constant` and `local` qualify a pointer, a slice or a
view, between the element type and the suffix: `float32 global*`,
`float32 shared[]`, `float16 constant[,]`. A plain `T*` inside a kernel is
generic and stays legal, so nothing that was written before has to change.

What the space buys is the access. A device helper taking `float32*` loads
through the generic path, which resolves the space at run time; the same helper
taking `float32 global*` emits `ld.global.f32`, one taking `float32 shared*`
emits `ld.shared.f32`, and one taking `float32 constant*` emits
`ld.global.nc.f32`, the read-only cache path for memory the kernel only reads.
A `constant` pointer names ordinary device memory: the constant bank is not
where a launch's allocation is, so the non-coherent load is what the qualifier
means here.

Spaces flow one way. A `T global*` becomes a `T*` for free, because forgetting
where something lives claims nothing. A workgroup or private address that
becomes a plain `T*` (by a cast, an assignment, or a helper's plain
parameter) is converted to a generic address where it does (`cvta.shared` /
`cvta.local`), and every access through that pointer is generic. Plain
pointers that only ever hold global addresses, a kernel's parameters among
them, still load and store `.global`. Going the other way is a claim, so it
needs the cast `(T global*)value`, which `mettle test` re-checks when it runs
the grid. Handing a `shared` pointer where a `global` one is wanted is refused
outright, and the message names both spaces: they are two different memories,
and no cast makes one the other. The same rule holds at a launch, where a
kernel parameter's space is part of the `extern kernel` signature `dispatch`
checks. A kernel parameter cannot be `shared` or `local`: a launch has no
workgroup tile and no work-item frame to hand over, and the compiler says so.

`align(N)` is the second half of the type: `float32 global align(16)*` says the
address is 16-byte aligned. It is a proof, not an annotation. A cast to an
aligned type is accepted only where the compiler can already see the
alignment -- from a `shared` declaration, from a pointer that already declared
one, or from the arithmetic of the offset -- and refused with the alignment the
expression actually reached:

```
error: this address is 4-byte aligned and the cast claims 16; the offset it is
       built from is not bounded to 16
```

An offset held in a local carries its proof in a declared type:

```mettle
type Quad = int32 where value % 4 == 0;
var offset: Quad = (Quad)(lane * 4);
row = (float32 global align(16)*)&rows[offset];
```

A declared alignment is what licenses a vector access: four adjacent `f32`
loads through a `float32 global align(16)*` become one `ld.global.v4.f32`, and
two through an `align(8)` pointer become one `ld.global.v2.f32`. Without the
declared alignment the loads stay separate, because nothing proved the address.
The declared alignment also reaches the kernel signature as
`.param .u64 .ptr.global.align 16`, so the driver holds the launch to it.

`--report-gpu-types` says what these analyses concluded and what they cost:

```
GPU type report: 5 of 5 device accesses named their space, 0 stayed generic
  1 vector groups formed from a declared alignment, 3 separate loads removed
  the analyses took 0.041 ms
```

### Layouts as types

A view can carry its extents:

```mettle
workgroup var tile: float32[32, 32] layout swizzle128;
```

`T[E0, E1]` is a view whose shape is in its type. It is one pointer: nothing
travels beside the data, because the extents are already known. Every index
into one is proven against the extent rather than tested at run time, by the
routes a declared type uses -- a constant, a declared type's range, a
dominating test, or the launch's own block shape where the index is a work-item
index. An index the compiler cannot bound is refused:

```text
error[E0003]: this index is not bounded to 0..31, which
              'float32[32,32] layout row' is; give it a declared type, test it,
              or write a constant
```

`layout <name>` says the order the elements sit in. The names live in
`std/warp` as constants, so a target that grows another form adds a name there
and nothing in the grammar moves:

| Layout | Element (i, j) at |
|--------|-------------------|
| `row` (the default) | `i * E1 + j` |
| `col` | `j * E0 + i` |
| `interleave(k)` | `(j / k) * (E0 * k) + i * k + (j % k)` |
| `swizzle64` | `i * E1 + ((j / C) ^ (i % (E1 / C))) * C + (j % C)`, C = 8 bytes |
| `swizzle128` | the same with C = 16 bytes |
| `fragment_a`, `fragment_b`, `fragment_c` | one work item's share of an MMA tile, in registers; these have no element address, and a kernel local of such a type is a [register tile](#register-tiles) |

The layout is part of the type, so a view laid out one way does not flow into a
parameter that names another, and the refusal names the layout that was
wanted:

```text
error[E0004]: Type mismatch: expected 'float32 shared[32,32] layout row',
              found 'float32[32,32] layout swizzle128'
  help: this wants elements laid out 'row' and these are laid out 'swizzle128';
        convert between the two where the change of order is meant, which is a
        copy
```

`layout_copy(destination, source)` is that conversion, and it is a statement
because reordering a tile is a copy. It takes two views of the same shape and
element laid out differently, and moves every element from where one order puts
it to where the other does.

Bank-conflict freedom is a proof, not a hope. `@conflict_free!` on a statement
asks the compiler to show that the addresses one subgroup touches in each
workgroup access inside it fall in distinct banks. The indices are evaluated
for every work item of a subgroup, the layout turns each pair into an offset,
and the banks are compared; how wide a subgroup is, how many banks there are
and how many bytes each holds come from the target description
(`subgroup_width`, `shared_memory_banks`, `shared_bank_bytes`). A refusal names
the two work items and the bank:

```text
error[E0003]: '@conflict_free!' says one subgroup's addresses fall in distinct
              workgroup banks, and work items 0 and 1 both land in bank 0, so
              this access is two accesses
```

A column read of a 32 by 32 float32 tile is the plain case: laid out `row` it
is 32 work items on one bank, laid out `col` it is 32 work items on 32 banks.
The swizzles keep a row read on 32 banks while moving a column read off one:
`swizzle64` spreads it over 16 banks and `swizzle128` over 8, which is better
and is not conflict-free, so `@conflict_free!` still refuses them for that
access.

`--report-gpu-types` and `--explain` print what each view ended up with and
which proofs were discharged:

```text
proven by type
  line 12 in column_read: tile is shared memory, laid out col, extents 32 by 32
  line 16 in column_read: one subgroup's 32 addresses through
      'float32[32,32] layout col' fall in 32 distinct banks
```

### Uniformity as a declared type

A value is uniform when every work item of the group holds the same one.
`std/warp` declares it:

```mettle
export type Uniform<T> = T where uniform(value);
```

`uniform(value)` is a predicate the compiler discharges, so nothing is uniform
by assertion. A value is uniform when it depends on no work-item index, on no
load from memory, and on nothing that is not itself uniform, computed through
the calls in the kernel's own call graph. A kernel's parameters are uniform,
because the launch handed every work item the same ones; `block.x`,
`block_dim.x` and `grid_dim.x` are uniform; `thread.x` and
`subgroup_local_id()` are not. What it cannot prove it refuses, naming the term
that varies:

```text
error[P0001]: cannot prove `gpu_tid_x()` is the same in every work item, which
              'Uniform<int32>' requires: thread.x varies by work item
```

A branch on a `Uniform<bool>` is a group decision and lowers to `bra.uni`,
which is the uniform datapath sm_75 and newer have; on an older target it is an
ordinary branch and means the same thing. `@uniform!` is the contract form on
an `if`, a `while` or a `for`, and it fails the build naming the term that made
the condition divergent:

```mettle
@uniform! if (block.x < rows) { /* every work item takes the same arm */ }
```

The claim is re-asked twice more. Under `mettle test` the grid runner compares
a `Uniform` value across the work items of a warp and reports the value and the
two work items when they differ. Under `--gpu-checks` the device asks the same
question with a warp vote: lane 0's value is broadcast, every lane compares, and
a vote that is not unanimous traps.

### Collective effects

`Warp` and `Block` are built-in effects. A kernel entry provides both, because
a launch starts every work item of a warp and of a block together. A collective
requires one, and they are ordinary functions in `std/warp` carrying the
clause:

```mettle
export fn warp_sum_f32(value: float32) -> float32 requires Warp {
  return subgroup_reduce_add(value);
}
```

So the ordinary effect machinery carries the requirement up the call graph: a
helper that calls one needs `Warp` too, and nobody writes that down.

A branch or a loop the work items of a group do not all decide the same way
takes the group effects away again. Inside it, `Warp` and `Block` are no longer
provided, so a collective reached there is `F0002` with the chain and the line
that removed them:

```text
error[F0002]: 'row_sums' provides 'Warp' and a branch at line 7 takes it away
              again: no work item agrees on that condition, so the group a
              collective there speaks to is not all present: row_sums ->
              warp_sum_f32
```

An `if` on a `Uniform<bool>` keeps them, and so does `@uniform! if`. A loop
whose trip count is uniform keeps them in its body; one whose trip count is not
does not. That is the whole reason uniformity and the group effects belong
together: the uniformity proof is what decides whether a collective is
reachable.

A call to a device function that only computes from its arguments, with no
loads, no lane or subgroup intrinsics and no calls that do either, is as
uniform as its arguments. Any other call's result varies.

A workgroup barrier is the block collective the compiler already knew about: a
device helper holding one needs `Block` wherever it is called from, and a
barrier the work items of a block do not all reach is refused by the device
verifier, which names the condition. Under `mettle test` the grid runner counts
arrivals per barrier per block and reports the site and the count.

`std/warp` is a separate module from `std/gpu` for one reason: it is device
code, and a host program that imported it would carry functions it can never
run. A kernel file imports `std/warp`; a host file imports `std/gpu`.

### Running the grid on the CPU

`dispatch` inside a `@test` function runs the kernel's grid in the compiler's
own interpreter, with no driver and no device:

```bash
mettle test kernels.mettle
```

The index built-ins answer per work item, a block's `workgroup` storage is
allocated once and shared by its work items, `private` storage is each work
item's own, and a barrier cuts the block into phases: every live work item runs
to the same barrier, and only then do they all go on. So a kernel that writes a
tile, barriers, and reads the tile back gives the same answers it gives on the
device.

Each work item runs on its own stack, so it can stop anywhere, in a helper as
well as in the kernel. The work items of a subgroup run together at every
subgroup operation: a shuffle, broadcast, ballot, reduction or scan waits until
all of them reach it and then computes in the order the PTX backend emits (a
reduction folds at offsets 16, 8, 4, 2, 1). A `barrier(subgroup, ...)` is the
same meeting with no data. Every pointer-typed `workgroup var` of a kernel
names the one dynamic arena, sized by the dispatch's `shared:` bytes, as on the
device.

The runner also executes what the tensor kernels use:

- `async_copy_workgroup` copies land when the issuing work item's
  `async_copy_wait` retires their group; a read of bytes still in flight stops
  the run and names the copy's line.
- `tensor_mma` from memory runs once per subgroup, element by element: dense
  f16/bf16 with f32 accumulators (each 16-deep K step summed exactly and
  rounded once, which can differ from the device in the last place), and
  block-scaled int8 with i8 or halves-packed 4-bit B, in the backend's own
  sequence of roundings, which is the device's bit for bit. Layouts, leading
  dimensions, swizzles, zero points, C = `0.0` and the per-row C scale are
  honored.
- Transaction barriers and `tma_load_2d` work from a map described with
  `numerics_tensor_map_2d`: the load copies the box (zeros past the edges),
  swizzled as the map says, and counts its bytes against the barrier.

`gemm_q4_0_i8` and `gemm_q4_0_i8_64` from the inference engine, run this way
and on an RTX 5060 Ti from the same inputs, agree bit for bit.

What the run is for is the re-checks. It is a machine that executes and proves
nothing, so what it finds is what the analyses got wrong:

- a pointer that claims a space its storage does not have, however the address
  reached it, reports the claim and the storage:
  `line 14 claims global memory and this address is in shared memory`;
- a pointer that claims an alignment the address does not have reports the
  offset it is off by;
- a barrier some work item walked around reports the site and the count:
  `the barrier at line 9 was reached by 2 of the 4 work items still running in
  this workgroup`.

One limit is worth knowing: the grid is capped at 65536 work items, which is
a CPU twin's size and not a launch's.

### Static and launch-sized workgroup memory, private memory, and barriers

Kernels can allocate statically sized scalar arrays in semantic address spaces:

```mettle
kernel staged(x: float32*, out: float32*, n: int32) {
  workgroup var tile: float32[256];
  private var scratch: int32[4];
  var lane: int32 = thread.x;
  if (lane < 256 && lane < n) { tile[lane] = x[lane]; }
  barrier(workgroup, global, acq_rel);
  if (lane < 256 && lane < n) { out[lane] = tile[lane]; }
}
```

These declarations are kernel-only, require a nonzero static array extent and a
scalar numeric element type, cannot have declaration initializers, and cannot be
rebound (their elements remain mutable). PTX maps them to `.shared` / `.local`;
SPIR-V maps them to real `Workgroup` / `Private` `OpVariable` arrays. They enter
both emitters as one target-neutral address-space allocation IR operation.

A pointer-shaped workgroup binding is an unbounded typed view of the dynamic
arena whose byte size is supplied by the host launch:

```mettle
kernel dynamic_staged(x: float32*, out: float32*, n: int32) {
  workgroup var values: float32*;
  workgroup var metadata: uint32*;
  var lane: int32 = thread.x;
  if (lane < n) {
    values[lane] = x[lane];
    metadata[256 + lane] = (uint32)lane;
  }
  barrier(workgroup, acq_rel);
  if (lane < n) { out[lane] = values[lane]; }
}
```

Every dynamic view in a kernel aliases the same base. Kernels partition it with
ordinary element offsets, must preserve each view's natural alignment, and must
keep accesses within the launch's dynamic byte count; the kernel receives no
implicit bounds value. PTX emits one module-scope external shared array per
kernel. SPIR-V appends one legal `Workgroup` pointer kernel argument, choosing
the most strictly aligned view type, and materializes all views from it. The
OpenCL host adapter must bind the launch byte count to that hidden local-memory
argument. PTX execution is sanitizer-tested; SPIR-V is `spirv-val`-validated,
but that host-binding path has not yet been execution-tested here.

`barrier(regions..., order)` is a uniform workgroup collective. Regions are
`workgroup` and/or `global`; the order is `acquire`, `release`, `acq_rel`, or
`seq_cst`. With no arguments it defaults to workgroup memory and sequential
consistency. Every live work-item in the workgroup must reach the statement.
SPIR-V receives the exact order and memory-class bits. PTX `bar.sync` is a full
CTA barrier and therefore deliberately strengthens acquire/release-only forms.
The legacy `gpu_barrier()` intrinsic remains accepted as a workgroup/seq-cst
compatibility alias.

### Target-neutral asynchronous staging

Mettle exposes asynchronous staging as a memory operation, not as a PTX
spelling:

```mettle
kernel stage(src: uint32*, out: uint32*) {
  workgroup var tile: uint32[128];
  var lane: int32 = thread.x;
  var base: int32 = lane * 4;
  async_copy_workgroup(&tile[base], src + base, 4,
                       transaction: 16, cache: global);
  async_copy_commit();
  async_copy_wait(0);
  barrier(workgroup, acq_rel);
  out[base] = tile[base];
}
```

Each copy moves matching scalar elements from global to workgroup storage for
the issuing work-item. `transaction` is 4, 8, or 16 bytes; the total byte span
must be a transaction multiple, and both addresses have that runtime alignment
precondition. `cache: all|global` is a performance hint. A commit closes the
current group, and `async_copy_wait(n)` waits until at most `n` newer groups
remain. The public pending range is 0..7 and every function exit must have no
outstanding or uncommitted group. The shared verifier checks this over the
whole CFG, including branches and loops.

A wait makes completion visible only to the issuing work-item. Other work-items
must not consume staged data until a uniform workgroup barrier publishes it;
`acq_rel` is the normal handoff. Reading an overlapping destination before its
wait is invalid. PTX 7.0/sm_80 and newer lower eligible operations to
`cp.async.{ca,cg}.shared.global`, `commit_group`, and `wait_group`. Portable
PTX and OpenCL 2.0 SPIR-V replay typed copies synchronously while preserving
commit/wait/barrier ordering. Compiler-owned PTX workgroup allocations are at
least 32-byte aligned, covering 16-byte transactions and WMMA tile loads; raw
global pointers retain their documented runtime precondition.

With `-O`, the shared optimizer can form the same neutral region from ordinary
typed global loads followed by their single-use workgroup stores. It proves
address-space provenance, scalar width, natural transaction alignment,
single-use connectivity, straight-line control, a later acq-rel/seq-cst
workgroup barrier, and absence of intervening memory effects. Commit is placed
before independent scalar work and wait immediately before publication. A
function containing explicit async groups is left alone, so generated staging
never splices into user-managed pending-group state. Source Mettle and public
libmtlc builders use the identical pass; the backend chooses native versus
synchronous realization only after neutral legality succeeds.

A branch that only some threads take, whose body is nothing but async copies
and the arithmetic that addresses them (`if (tid < 128) { async_copy_workgroup(...); }`),
is not emitted as a branch. The arithmetic runs on every thread, and each
copy carries the branch's predicate (`@!p cp.async...`), so no thread copies
anything it would not have. Around such a branch in a GEMM's K loop, ptxas
has been seen to front-load the tensor instructions (255 registers, about
three moves per MMA, in an earlier version of the inference engine's TMA
GEMM). Predication leaves it no branch to schedule around. A branch the type
checker proves uniform keeps its branch. Predicating it would only make its address arithmetic run when
the copies do not.

### Transaction barriers and tensor-map loads

On sm_90 and newer (PTX 8.0+), a kernel can stage tiles with the Tensor
Memory Accelerator instead of per-thread copies. The built-in intrinsics
(listed under Built-in intrinsics) map one to one onto the PTX:

| Intrinsic | PTX | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `mbarrier_init(bar, count)` | `mbarrier.init.shared::cta.b64` | one thread, before any use; `count` arrivals complete a phase |
| `fence_mbarrier_init()` | `fence.mbarrier_init.release.cluster` | after the inits, before the barrier that publishes them |
| `tensormap_acquire(map)` | `fence.proxy.tensormap::generic.acquire.gpu` | before the first load through a map the host wrote |
| `mbarrier_arrive_expect_tx(bar, bytes)` | `mbarrier.arrive.expect_tx.release.cta.shared::cta.b64` | the issuing thread arrives and says how many bytes the phase waits for |
| `tma_load_2d(dst, map, c0, c1, bar)` | `cp.async.bulk.tensor.2d...mbarrier::complete_tx::bytes` | copies the box at (c0, c1) to `dst`, counting its bytes against `bar` |
| `mbarrier_wait_parity(bar, parity)` | a `mbarrier.try_wait.parity` loop | every thread waits for the phase with that parity |
| `fence_proxy_async()` | `fence.proxy.async.shared::cta` | before a TMA overwrites a stage the threads wrote or read with ordinary instructions |

A barrier is a `uint64` in workgroup memory, and a map is a `CUtensorMap` (128
bytes, 64-byte aligned) in global memory that the host builds with
`cuTensorMapEncodeTiled`. A swizzled map wants its destination tile aligned to
the swizzle's period: `align(1024)` on a dynamic workgroup pointer raises the
`.extern .shared` alignment to match, and `tensor_mma`'s `a_swizzle` /
`b_swizzle` read the tile the way the copy left it.

```mettle
workgroup var s8: uint8 align(1024)*;
var bar: uint64 shared* = (uint64 shared*)(s8 + 32768);
if (thread.x == 0) {
  mbarrier_init(bar, 1);
  fence_mbarrier_init();
  tensormap_acquire(map);
}
barrier(workgroup, acq_rel);
if (thread.x == 0) {
  mbarrier_arrive_expect_tx(bar, 16384);
  tma_load_2d((uint8 shared*)s8, map, k0, row0, bar);
}
mbarrier_wait_parity(bar, 0);
```

From PTX 8.6 the copy's destination is written `shared::cta`. Before that
only `shared::cluster` exists, and ptxas guards every such load with a check
of the address's CTA rank and a called slow path. That costs a GEMM's K loop
its register allocation. `tensor_transfer`'s native tensor-map path chooses
its destination form by version the same way.

### Scoped atomics

Atomics are native, type-directed kernel operations over `uint32*`, `uint64*`,
or matching workgroup arrays. They are not extern calls and carry a target-
neutral address space, memory order, and scope into shared IR:

```mettle
var ticket: uint64 = atomic_fetch_add(queue_head, index, 1,
                                      order: acq_rel, scope: device);
atomic_store(ready, index, 1, order: release, scope: device);
var published: uint32 = atomic_load(ready, index,
                                    order: acquire, scope: device);
var old: uint32 = atomic_compare_exchange(
    state, index, expected, desired,
    success_order: acq_rel, failure_order: acquire, scope: device);
```

The u32/u64 family includes load, store, fetch add/sub/min/max/and/or/xor,
exchange, and compare-exchange. Value-returning operations return the observed
old value; store returns `void`. Element indices remain 64-bit through backend
address generation. Storage provenance is inferred as global or workgroup and
may be stated with `space:`. Global operations default to device scope;
workgroup operations default to workgroup scope. All default to seq-cst. Loads
permit relaxed/acquire/seq-cst, stores relaxed/release/seq-cst, and RMWs all
five C/C++ orders. CAS carries separate success and failure orders; failure may
not be release/acq-rel or stronger than success.

PTX emits scoped ordered `ld`/`st`/`atom` instructions and NVIDIA's required
`fence.sc` sequences for sequential consistency. SPIR-V emits `OpAtomicLoad`,
`OpAtomicStore`, and the matching RMW/CAS operations with exact Scope, ordering,
and memory-class operands. Optional u64 SPIR-V atomics require the OpenCL
`cl_khr_int64_base_atomics` and `cl_khr_int64_extended_atomics` extensions.
The real-device message-passing test uses an actual release store paired with
an acquire load; contended RMW/CAS and workgroup atomics are checked separately.

### Subgroup collectives

Mettle/libmtlc defines a subgroup as an implementation-sized set of work-items,
not as a CUDA warp. The initial portable collective surface is:

| Reference Mettle alias | Contract |
|---|---|
| `subgroup_local_id() -> uint32` | caller's zero-based lane within its subgroup |
| `subgroup_size() -> uint32` | number of lanes in the current subgroup |
| `subgroup_broadcast(value, source_lane)` | u32/f32 value from one uniform, valid source lane, returned to every lane |
| `subgroup_reduce_add(value)` | u32/f32 subgroup sum, returned to every lane |
| `subgroup_reduce_min(value)` / `subgroup_reduce_max(value)` | u32/f32 subgroup extrema, returned to every lane |
| `subgroup_scan_inclusive_add(value)` | u32/f32 prefix sum including the caller's value |
| `subgroup_scan_exclusive_add(value)` | u32/f32 prefix sum preceding the caller, with zero identity |
| `subgroup_shuffle(value, source_lane)` | u32/f32 value from a per-lane source; an inactive or out-of-range source returns the caller's value |
| `subgroup_ballot(predicate, word)` | 32-bit word of the active-lane predicate mask; words outside the implementation mask are zero |
| `subgroup_any(predicate)` / `subgroup_all(predicate)` | subgroup-wide boolean vote over active lanes |

These are native, type-checked Mettle kernel built-ins; no declaration or CUDA
header is required. Another frontend uses the corresponding typed
`MTLC_INTRINSIC_GPU_SUBGROUP_*` identities directly. Every live lane must
execute a collective in uniform control flow.
The broadcast source lane must be identical and in range for the whole subgroup;
shuffle source lanes may vary. Ballot is word-addressed so a backend is never
forced to narrow its implementation-sized mask into one scalar. The current
portable mask contract exposes words 0 through 3 and returns zero for any
larger word index.
Unsigned addition wraps modulo 2^32. Floating-point reduction order is
implementation-defined, so it is not bit-reproducible across backends.

The shared IR call-graph verifier enforces statically visible uniformity before
either GPU backend runs. Its lattice distinguishes values uniform across a
workgroup, values uniform only within a subgroup, and work-item-varying values.
Kernel arguments and group topology are workgroup-uniform; broadcast and
reduction and vote results are subgroup-uniform, while shuffle, scan, and a
ballot selected with a varying word index vary by lane. Local
IDs, memory loads, and opaque call results are conservatively varying. Helper parameter ranks are joined from every
reachable call site. Collectives under control that is insufficiently uniform for their
scope, varying-trip loops, and work-item-varying broadcast lanes are rejected
without putting backend reconvergence rules in the frontend.

PTX maps a subgroup to the 32-lane NVIDIA warp and uses `activemask`,
`shfl.sync`, and `vote.sync`. The reduction guards every tree edge with the active mask, so a
uniform partial final warp need not have a power-of-two lane count. SPIR-V uses
`SubgroupLocalInvocationId`, `SubgroupSize`, the native SPIR-V 1.0 `Groups`
broadcast/add/min/max reduce and scan operations, and the standardized
`SPV_KHR_shader_ballot` / `SPV_KHR_subgroup_vote` operations. An OpenCL consumer
must support the corresponding subgroup extensions. The current OpenCL 2.0
profile cannot represent a varying-source shuffle; it reports that capability
gap rather than miscompiling it as uniform broadcast.

### Cooperative tensor operations

`tensor_mma` is a native Mettle kernel operation for one collective
`D = A * B + C` tile. It is deliberately a whole-tile memory operation: source
code and shared IR describe the arithmetic, element formats, shape, layouts,
leading dimensions, rounding, overflow, sparsity, scaling, and collective
scope. They never expose PTX register fragments, lane-to-fragment mappings, or
an NVIDIA instruction name.

```mettle
kernel gemm_tile(a: uint16*, b: uint16*, c: float32*, d: float32*) {
  tensor_mma(a, b, c, d,
             shape: m16n16k16,
             input_type: f16,
             output_type: f32,
             a_layout: row, b_layout: col,
             c_layout: row, d_layout: row);
}
```

C may be the constant `0.0`: the accumulator starts at +0.0 and no C is read.
`tensor_mma(a, b, 0.0, d, ...)` is the first update of a K loop that does not
need a zero buffer, and two kernels that start this way start from the same
value whatever memory holds. Any other constant C is refused.

For whole problems, `tensor_matmul` applies that same target-neutral descriptor
to one bounded output region. A typical 2-D launch assigns one subgroup to one
logical region:

```mettle
kernel gemm_region(a: uint16*, b: uint16*, c: float32*, d: float32*,
                   problem_m: uint32, problem_n: uint32, problem_k: uint32,
                   lda: uint32, ldb: uint32, ldc: uint32, ldd: uint32) {
  var row: uint32 = (uint32)block.y * (uint32)16;
  var column: uint32 = (uint32)block.x * (uint32)16;
  tensor_matmul(a, b, c, d, row, column,
                problem_m, problem_n, problem_k,
                shape: m16n16k16,
                input_type: f16, output_type: f32,
                lda: lda, ldb: ldb, ldc: ldc, ldd: ldd);
}

dispatch gemm_region[
  grid: ((n + 15) / 16, (m + 15) / 16, 1),
  block: (32, 1, 1)
](a, b, c, d, m, n, k, lda, ldb, ldc, ldd);
```

The exact region semantics are, for every `row+local_row < problem_m` and
`column+local_column < problem_n`,
`D[r,c] = C[r,c] + sum(q=0..problem_k-1) A[r,q]*B[q,c]` under the descriptor's
numeric rules. Out-of-range output coordinates do nothing; `problem_k == 0`
copies C to D for the active region. The descriptor M/N are the region size and
descriptor K is a preferred exact native chunk, not permission to round the
problem down. Origins and M/N/K are unsigned, collective-uniform runtime
values. Whole matrices require explicit `lda`/`ldb`/`ldc`/`ldd`; runtime
leading dimensions are uniform unsigned values in the descriptor's uint32
range. Pointer slicing remains the backend-neutral way to select a batch, so a
`grid.z` batch does not add a vendor-specific tensor ABI.

`tensor_matmul` has its own shared-IR operation. Its operands are ordinary
matrix pointers, optional neutral metadata/scale/stride values, and the five
unsigned region controls; it does not lower into a frontend loop or expose a
fragment. Shared verification checks exact pointer/control types and collective
uniformity. It is intentionally not eligible for the single-tile chain/loop
optimizer.

The current PTX backend supports exact dense, subgroup-scoped
f16/bf16-to-f32, f64, i8/u8-to-i32-wrap, unscaled E4M3/E5M2-to-f32, and
block-scaled FP8/FP6/FP4-to-f32 regions, plus matching f16 or bf16 structured
2:4 A with f32 accumulation/result. Independent A/B transpose is supported
under either stored layout. For stable-WMMA families, a full M/N interior is
native when the tuple budget permits it: PTX
normalizes a transposed stored layout into the opposite backend-local logical
view, C is
loaded once, all complete runtime-K chunks remain in the accumulator, and D is
stored once. A K remainder then continues cooperatively from that exact-width
D value. Partial M/N regions, K smaller than one native chunk, partial warps,
and tuple-budget refusals use complete cooperative scalar replay with 64-bit
address arithmetic. In that path transpose swaps logical coordinates before
applying the selected stored layout; it never materializes a frontend or
shared-IR transpose. Unscaled FP8 edges use PTX's architectural
packed-FP8-to-f16 conversion followed by f32 widening; complete interiors retain
backend-private direct-MMA accumulators across runtime K.

Scaled regions use the same neutral scale contract as `tensor_mma`:
`scale_A` is row-major `[M, ceil(K/block)]`, `scale_B` is column-major
`[ceil(K/block), N]`, and both scale leading dimensions are explicit. Scale
coordinates stay logical even when A or B is transposed. FP6/FP4 dense storage
is the neutral least-significant-bit-first stream including logical stride
padding. Exact replay gathers values across byte boundaries, decodes
E2M1/E2M3/E3M2 and UE8M0 with backend-local integer arithmetic, decodes UE4M3
through the supported positive E4M3 conversion, applies both block scales, and
continues with f32 FMA. This deliberately avoids the narrower alternate-format
conversion instructions that PTX 8.8 does not qualify for `sm_121a`.

Complete scaled interiors retain native `mxf8f6f4`, MXFP4, or NVFP4
accumulators across runtime K and advance both scale grids per block. Canonical
row-A/column-B packed matrices use exact contiguous fragment loads when the
runtime logical stride is byte aligned (multiple of four values for FP6,
multiple of two for FP4). A uniform origin/stride guard sends every other case
to exact cooperative replay.

Structured 2:4 regions use the existing neutral compressed-A contract. Each
logical four-wide K group owns two stored A values in increasing selected-index
order and one uint8 mask; metadata is compact row-major
`[M,ceil(problem_k/4)]`. A partial final group still stores two values, while
logical positions outside runtime K do not contribute. A transpose changes
only compressed A's stored coordinates; metadata remains in logical row/group
order. PTX rebases complete K16 chunks by eight stored A values and four
metadata bytes, translates those masks to ordered `mma.sp` metadata, and keeps
the accumulator resident across runtime K. M/N/K edges and forced fallback
decode the same masks directly with 64-bit addresses and f32 FMA. Invalid masks
remain outside the source contract; both paths clamp them to the safe `0011`
mask before use as defensive hardening.

TF32 tails, reduced-precision accumulator/result, saturating integer tails,
and other sparse ratios/types remain explicit capability errors. Native
transpose, scaled paths, and bounded structured sparsity are offline-assembler
qualified, not device-numerically qualified. The OpenCL 2.0 SPIR-V profile also
rejects the operation explicitly.

CUDA 12.9 offline assembly accepts the five native-interior fixtures, three
exact-transpose fixtures, two unscaled direct-MMA FP8 fixtures, and four scaled
FP8/FP6/FP4 fixtures plus two structured-2:4 fixtures for `sm_121a` with zero
spills and zero stack. The
stable-WMMA modules peak at 40 registers, unscaled FP8 at 64, and the scaled
fixtures at 48 (mixed FP6), 48 (MXFP4), 56 (NVFP4), and 72 (scaled transposed
FP8); structured 2:4 uses 48 registers natively and 40 under forced replay. The
CPU oracle covers 19x23x21 unscaled, 19x23x67 scaled, and 19x23x19 sparse M/N/K tails,
E4M3/E5M2/E2M1/E2M3/E3M2/UE8M0/UE4M3 decoding, exact LSB-first streams,
independent A/B transpose, compact mask indexing, compressed selected-value
order, mixed layouts and padded strides, integer wrap, K=0, and out-of-range
no-op semantics. Neither result is GPU/GB10 numerical execution or performance
evidence.

The first four arguments are positional base pointers. Arithmetic configuration
is named and compile-time: `shape` (or separate `m`/`n`/`k`), independent
`a_type`/`b_type`/`accumulator_type`/`result_type`, four layouts,
`transpose_a`/`transpose_b`, `math`, `sparsity`, `rounding`, `overflow`, A/B
packing and scale modes/types, scale-table leading dimensions, and `subgroup`
or `workgroup` scope. Each of
`lda`/`ldb`/`ldc`/`ldd` may instead be a scalar integer expression, so one
compiled kernel can operate on padded, sliced, or batched matrices. Runtime
strides and all pointer operands must be uniform at the collective scope;
positive layout-compatible values are runtime preconditions.
`input_type` and `output_type` are conveniences, not a restricted type model.
Sparse/scaled descriptors take matching named `metadata`, `a_scale`, and
`b_scale` pointer operands. The public equivalent is `MtlcTensorMmaDesc` plus
`mtlc_tensor_mma` / `mtlc_tensor_mma_ex`; a frontend that already owns a tiled
operation can emit the same neutral accumulator chain with
`mtlc_tensor_mma_chain`. Dense sub-byte packing is target-neutral: consecutive
logical values occupy each byte from least- to most-significant bits, while all
matrix leading dimensions and pointer offsets remain logical element counts.
Block-scale metadata is canonical rather than vendor-fragment-shaped: A scales
are row-major `M x ceil(K/block)` and B scales are column-major
`ceil(K/block) x N`.

4-bit operands may also use `halves` packing, the block layout of GGML's
Q4_0/Q4_1/IQ4_NL: by linear storage position `p`, element `p` sits in byte
`16 * (p / 32) + p % 16`, in its low nibble when `p % 32 < 16` and its high
nibble otherwise. K must be a multiple of 32. An unsigned operand can carry a
constant `a_zero_point`/`b_zero_point` (0..15 for u4, 0..255 for u8): its
value is the stored integer minus that. Q4_0 weights are therefore B with
`b_type: u4, b_packing: halves, b_zero_point: 8`, exactly as stored.

Post-processing is a separate `tensor_epilogue` collective, so nonlinear
activation never changes an MMA chain's exact sequential semantics:

```mettle
kernel finish_tile(d: float32*, bias: float32*, alpha: float32,
                   beta: float32) {
  tensor_epilogue(d, shape: m32n16, element_type: f32,
                  bias_mode: column, bias: bias,
                  alpha: alpha, beta: beta, activation: relu);
}
```

Its exact operation is
`D[row,col] = activation(alpha*D[row,col] + beta*bias[row,col])`.
Omitted scales are one. Bias may be absent, per-row, per-column, or a matrix
with an independent row/column layout and static or uniform runtime leading
dimension. D has the same layout/stride choices; activation is identity, ReLU,
or clamp with uniform `clamp_min`/`clamp_max`. f16/bf16 storage computes in f32;
f32/f64 compute in their own format. Every pointer, scale, bound, and runtime
stride is uniform at subgroup or workgroup scope. ReLU replaces only ordered
negative values with positive zero. Clamp performs ordered lower- then
upper-bound replacement; unordered values survive either activation. An active
bias region must not overlap the destination region.

PTX always has entry-ordered, exit-ordered cooperative logical-memory replay.
It supports generic/global/workgroup storage, arbitrary nonzero M/N, both
layouts, every bias mode, and the four formats above.

For an exactly compatible adjacent MMA/commit and epilogue, PTX may instead
retain the accumulator. A verified loop commit can make the same handoff across
its exit jump only when the epilogue label has that jump as its sole incoming
edge and cannot be reached by fallthrough. An outer guard or any other bypass
forces the complete memory operation at the shared label. Compatibility in all
cases requires the same D pointer,
M/N, result format, layout, static or identical runtime stride, and subgroup
scope. Stable WMMA permits bias-free scale/ReLU/clamp because applying one
scalar operation to every accumulator register needs no fragment-coordinate
assumption; any bias forces replay because stable WMMA's coordinate mapping is
opaque. Direct m16n8 native MMA has an explicit backend-owned coordinate
mapping and supports every bias mode. Straight-line chains, verified staged
pipeline commits, and uniquely reached loop exits are covered. Tuple-budget
refusal, incompatible operands, unsupported mappings, and ambiguous control
flow fall back to the complete memory operation.

CUDA 12.9 `ptxas -arch=sm_121a` accepts the standalone
f16/bf16/f32/f64 matrix with zero spills and 14--21 registers. The resident
suite assembles with zero spills at 40 registers for a two-MMA stable-WMMA
scale/ReLU chain, 58 for a two-MMA FP8 matrix-bias/clamp chain, and 31 for a
staged commit handoff. Both the fused loop exit and guarded-loop replay use 40
registers; the forced memory-replay module peaks at 66 registers.
These are offline structural/resource results, not GB10 execution or
performance evidence. The current OpenCL 2.0 SPIR-V profile rejects the
operation explicitly until it has exact collective ordering and lowering.

Structured sparsity has an equally backend-neutral memory contract. A is the
sparse operand; logical K is divided into consecutive groups of 2, 4, or 8 for
1:2, 2:4, or 4:8. Each group stores exactly half of its values, in increasing
logical-index order, so A's leading dimension counts `K/2` stored elements.
`metadata` is a `uint8*` row-major `[M][K/group]` occupancy matrix: only the low
`group` bits are used and exactly `group/2` bits must be set. This is a Mettle
data format, not PTX sparse metadata; each backend must translate it or reject
the requested profile.

The target-neutral format vocabulary includes f16, bf16, tf32, f32, f64,
FP8 E4M3/E5M2, FP6 E2M3/E3M2, FP4 E2M1, UE8M0/UE4M3 scales, signed/unsigned
i8 and i4, b1, and i32. Until Mettle has first-class low-precision scalars,
f16/bf16 storage is passed as `uint16*`; byte FP8 and packed FP6/FP4/i4/b1
storage use `uint8*`. The descriptor, rather than that carrier spelling,
defines arithmetic meaning.

The PTX backend currently implements the complete stable PTX WMMA family below
as load/MMA/store sequences. The listed shapes are physical instructions. For
byte-addressable f16, bf16, tf32, f64, and i8/u8, a larger logical M/N shape up
to 256x256 may be an exact grid of the listed square physical shape: 16x16 for
K=16 f16/bf16/i8/u8, 16x16 for K=8 tf32, or 8x8 for K=4 f64. PTX computes every
subtile address from the neutral layout and leading dimension, then chooses an
A-outer or B-outer traversal to reuse the fragment that removes more loads.
The logical descriptor, shared IR, and result remain one whole tile.

A capability check either selects an exact physical shape/grid or rejects the
descriptor; it never truncates the logical tile or silently changes precision,
layout, sparsity, scale, rounding, or scope. The native and public-builder
32x32 f16 chain/loop gates retain four accumulator subtiles at a logical tuple
peak of 56, while a budget of 55 produces exact replay. CUDA 12.9 assembles the
f16, bf16, tf32, f64, i8, and u8 grid matrix, including f16-result,
row/column-layout, and runtime-leading-dimension variants, with zero spills;
this is structural evidence, not a GB10 performance or numerical-execution
claim.

| A/B format | Accumulator/result | Shapes | Additional rule |
|---|---|---|---|
| f16 | f16 or f32 | m16n16k16, m8n32k16, m32n8k16; 16x16 logical grids | row/column A and B |

| b1 | i32 | m8n8k128 | A row-major, B column-major; XOR/AND popcount |

On architecture-specific Blackwell targets, the same whole-tile operation also
selects native warp-level narrow floating-point MMA. Larger neutral M/N tiles
are backend-owned m16n8 subdivisions; accumulators stay resident across proved
chains and exact runtime-K loops.

| A/B format | Scale contract | Native PTX profile |
|---|---|---|
| FP8 E4M3/E5M2 | unscaled, byte storage | mixed types, K=16 or 32 |
| any FP8 E4M3/E5M2, FP6 E2M3/E3M2, or FP4 E2M1 A/B pair | UE8M0 block32 | `mxf8f6f4` `m16n8k32`, scale vector 1 |
| packed FP4 E2M1 | UE8M0 block32 | MXFP4 `m16n8k64`, scale vector 2 |
| packed FP4 E2M1 | UE4M3 block16 | NVFP4 `m16n8k64`, scale vector 4 |
| structured 2:4 f16 or bf16 | compressed A + canonical uint8 masks | `mma.sp` `m16n8k16`, f32 accumulator/result |
| i8/u8 A, i8/u8 or halves-packed i4/u4 B | f32 or f16 block32 on both | `mma.sync` `m16n8k32` s32 per block, scaled into f32 |
| dense f16 or bf16 A/B, K above 16 or a C row scale | unscaled; optional per-row C scale | `mma.sync` `m16n8k16`, f32 accumulator, unrolled over K |

The block-scaled profiles require PTX 8.8 and an architecture- or family-specific
`sm_120a`/`sm_121a` target. Raw `sm_121` is deliberately rejected because it
does not promise architecture-specific instructions.

Dense f16 and bf16 tiles that stable WMMA cannot take in one operation --
K above 16 -- and any tile with a per-row C scale (`c_scale_mode: per_row`,
D = diag(s) C + A B) run on the native `m16n8k16` MMA instead, unrolled
over K with the accumulators in registers; they need PTX 7.0 and sm_80+.
Operands in workgroup memory whose rows are whole 16-byte groups load
through `ldmatrix`: a row-major A as one x4 a 16 x 16 fragment, a
column-major B as one x4 the b0/b1 pairs of two n8 columns, and a
row-major B transposed in the load. K = 16 tiles without a row scale keep
stable WMMA. An attention score tile (S = Q K^T over a whole head) is the
case this serves; it may sit inside the loop of a region-resident
accumulator of another shape and stays a whole-tile operation there.

Block-scaled integer MMA is the int8-activation counterpart (the arithmetic
of llama.cpp's MMQ): for each K32 block it forms the exact int32 dot of the
block and adds it to the f32 accumulator times `scale_A[row] * scale_B[col]`.
It needs PTX 7.0 and sm_80+, K=32 per tile, f32 accumulator/result, and
default rounding with wrap overflow. The block dot starts from the bits of
`1.5 * 2^23`, so its result reads as that float plus the dot (every s8/u8
K32 dot is below 2^22 in magnitude) and one exact `sub.f32` replaces the
quarter-rate `cvt.rn.f32.s32`. Row-major A and column-major B load four K
bytes per 32-bit read through a per-lane pointer with constant offsets. A
halves-packed 4-bit B costs one 32-bit load per n8 subtile -- the lane's word
holds its K `4t..4t+3` in the low nibbles and `16+4t..16+4t+3` in the high
ones -- widened in registers: `(x + 0x80 - z) ^ 0x80` per byte subtracts the
zero point `z` without carries, and signed nibbles take `x ^ 8` first.

A tile works through K one K32 block at a time. The block dots run as a ring
of four: each dot's epilogue (the `sub.f32` and the scale multiply-add into
the accumulator) is issued three MMAs after the dot, and the ring keeps
running across block boundaries. A block's scales load where its first
epilogue is due, so the MMA stream never waits on the float pipe. When B comes
through `ldmatrix` for four column tiles, one x4 per K block loads that
block's halves-packed words for all four tiles into four registers that the
next block reuses. The weight nibbles are live only for the block that uses
them.

Operands written by a tensor-map load keep the layout the copy left them in:
`a_swizzle` / `b_swizzle` (32, 64 or 128 bytes) read them through `ldmatrix`
at `p ^ key`, one key per lane. `a_scale_values` / `b_scale_values` say an f32
scale array holds f16 or bf16 values, which keeps the exact prefactor epilogue
for scales widened ahead of time. In a K loop staged through workgroup memory,
the f32 accumulator stays in registers through region residency (below) and
is committed once on the loop's exit.

The sparse f16/bf16 profile requires PTX 7.1 and sm_80+, subgroup scope,
M divisible by 16, N divisible by 8, and K=16. PTX translates each neutral mask
to its lane metadata and uses ordered metadata from PTX 8.5 onward. Invalid
dynamic masks are contract violations; the generated translation nevertheless
clamps them to a defined safe selector before issuing the tensor instruction,
rather than feeding an architecturally undefined metadata encoding to hardware.
For adjacent N subtiles, compressed A and translated metadata are prepared once
per M/K fragment and reused.

All live lanes in the subgroup must execute the operation uniformly with the
same descriptor, pointer values, and runtime leading dimensions. The pointed-to
tiles, leading dimensions, and base addresses must satisfy the selected PTX
WMMA layout and alignment requirements; those are runtime preconditions and
cannot generally be proved from a raw pointer. Generic, global, and workgroup
tile memory are accepted. The shared verifier rejects pointer or runtime-stride
expressions known to vary at the declared subgroup/workgroup scope.

The GB10 family is emitted at PTX 8.8 / `sm_121a` and assembled by CUDA 12.9
`ptxas -arch=sm_121a` in the validation suite. That proves syntax, register
tuples, target capability declarations, and zero-spill register ceilings. A
compute-12.0 development GPU additionally passes poisoned-padding
runtime-stride MMA and a 32x32x64
multi-tile f16/f32 GEMM against CPU oracles. The GEMM's runtime K loop loads C
once, executes one initial and three loop-carried WMMA updates in the resident
accumulator, and stores D once. A K=15 guard case proves that the commit is
bypassed when no complete K tile exists. A separate four-K-tile straight-line
chain has the same one-load/one-store property. Staged-pipeline tests cover
both a double-buffered two-tile schedule and a four-group schedule. The latter
issues eight native 16-byte copies, drains pending groups with waits 3 through
0, retains one accumulator through all four wait/publication handoffs, and
executes four MMAs with one C load and one D store. Distinct per-tile numerical
oracles pass on the same device. Native mixed FP8, mixed E3M2/E2M3 dense FP6,
MXFP4/UE8M0 block32, and NVFP4/UE4M3 block16 each pass direct whole-tile,
resident-chain, and runtime-K residency oracles with independently varied rows,
columns, scale chunks, logical strides, and poisoned padding. The public-builder
  gate additionally emits and assembles all 25 documented `mxf8f6f4` FP8/FP6/FP4
  A/B type pairs for both whole-tile and exact whole-matrix operations. Canonical
  byte-aligned FP6 fragments use an exact three-byte load per four values;
  transpose/noncanonical cases retain a boundary-safe bit gather or exact region
  replay.

A separate earlier source-expressed tail-complete GEMM keeps the resident WMMA path for every full
16x16 output tile and full K prefix, then uses typed f16-to-f32 scalar work for
M, N, and K edges in the same kernel. A 19x23x21 launch simultaneously proves
tensor interior, row/column edges, K-tail publication, runtime padded strides,
and untouched poison padding; a 16x16x7 launch proves the no-tensor scalar path.
That fixture remains useful device evidence for explicit composition. The new
`tensor_matmul` operation now makes native full-K residency plus exact M/N/K
edge selection backend-generated for each bounded region. Generating the 2-D
launch grid, batch pointer slicing, layout transforms, and architecture-tuned
region size for an arbitrary higher-level GEMM is still open.

Structured 2:4 f16/bf16 source and public-builder whole-tile kernels emit the
expected ordered `mma.sp` form for `sm_121a`; bounded `tensor_matmul` regions
now combine that native K16 interior with exact sparse M/N/K replay. CUDA 12.9
`ptxas` accepts whole tiles at 40 registers and bounded regions at 48 registers,
with zero spills and no `tcgen05` dependency. A-fragment coordinates and
the lower-row/upper-row halves of the metadata word have also been checked
against the PTX 8.8 fragment equations and Figure 119. A CPU oracle checks
compressed selected-value order, compact masks, transpose, odd K, K=0, and
no-op bounds. This remains CPU semantic plus offline structural evidence only;
GPU sparse numerics, malformed-input behavior beyond defensive clamping,
performance, and actual GB10 execution remain unqualified gates.

With `-O`, adjacent exact compositions of the form `D=A0*B0+C;
D=A1*B1+D; ...` become one backend-neutral tensor-chain instruction. Fusion is
legal only when descriptor semantics, result/accumulator type, C/D layout,
output pointer, and output leading dimension agree and no observable IR
instruction intervenes. PTX uses an inspectable tuple-pressure model (64
logical registers before sm_90, 96 from sm_90) and annotates its choice as
`mtlc.tensor_chain resident ...` or `replay ...`. A resident chain performs one
C load and one D store; an over-budget chain replays the exact component
operations. Another backend may always replay without changing the frontend or
shared IR.

`--gpu-tensor-tuple-budget=N` overrides that PTX ceiling for variant generation;
`N=0` restores the architecture default. The equivalent public-context policy
is `mtlc_context_set_ptx_tensor_tuple_budget`. This is deliberately backend-only:
the optimized neutral chain/loop/pipeline remains identical, while PTX chooses
resident or replay. It is a hook for measurement-driven tuning, not an
occupancy or performance claim by itself; final registers/spills come from
`ptxas`, and useful thresholds require real workload timing.

`tools/gpu/ptxas_profile.py --arch sm_121a --require-zero-spills -o
resources.json kernel.ptx` turns that offline assembler evidence into stable
JSON: input hashes plus per-function registers, spill traffic, stack, barriers,
shared memory, constant memory, and lexical PTX instruction-class counts.
`--max-registers=N` makes the same command a reproducible resource gate. The
tool deletes its temporary cubin and never creates a CUDA context, queries a
device, loads a module, or launches code; its output is offline evidence, not
runtime evidence.

`tools/gpu/ptxas_select.py` compares two or more such profiles under an explicit
resource model: threads per block, registers/shared memory per execution unit,
warp and block limits, and allocation granularities. It computes register-,
shared-memory-, and warp-limited residency bounds, rejects spills by default,
and emits a per-entry Pareto frontier over occupancy, resource headroom, and
static global-memory instruction count. The default `pareto` policy deliberately
leaves a resident-versus-replay tradeoff unresolved; `--policy=occupancy` or
`--policy=traffic` makes that policy explicit, while `--require-selection`
fails closed on ambiguity. The JSON always records `performance_claim: false`:
static counts and modeled occupancy are inputs to real autotuning, not a
substitute for timed GB10 workloads.

For the checked-in DGX workflow, the explicit 12.x upper-limit model comes from
NVIDIA's [compute-capability resource tables](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-programming-guide/05-appendices/compute-capabilities.html):
64K 32-bit registers, 100KB shared memory, 48 resident warps, 24 resident
blocks, and 32 threads per warp. The workflow deliberately uses allocation unit
1 because that table does not specify the allocation granularity; its result is
therefore an upper bound and the archived JSON records the assumption.

For measured selection, pass `--policy=measured --measurements=timings.json`.
The input follows `tools/gpu/variant_measurements.schema.json` and binds every
candidate to the SHA-256 of its exact resource profile, every entry to a
workload hash and launch shape, and the run to a device UUID, host architecture,
compute capability, integrated/discrete-memory fact, and driver version.
`samples_ns[i]` across candidates is one paired round; collectors must warm up
separately and interleave/randomize candidate order so index-aligned samples do
not encode drift. The selector never collects those samples itself.

The default measured gate requires at least 21 positive pairs, chooses the
lowest median only provisionally, then compares it against every eligible
candidate using a two-sided paired sign test with Bonferroni-corrected
`alpha=0.01` and a median paired speedup of at least 1.01. The thresholds are
recorded and configurable. If either statistical significance or practical
effect is missing, selection remains null; even a passing local selection keeps
`performance_claim: false` because it is evidence for that bound workload and
device, not a general competitive claim.

The same shared optimizer also recognizes an exact linear runtime loop after an
initial tile. It requires one connected MMA update, identical descriptor and
output-stride semantics, a single loop entry/backedge, and a body containing
only register-local address/counter arithmetic. Loads, stores, calls, atomics,
barriers, a second MMA, or any other observable body operation refuse the
transform. The optimizer inserts a neutral `tensor_commit` on only the loop's
exit edge; outer guards that share the original end label bypass that commit.
The shared GPU verifier independently rebuilds the CFG and rechecks the unique
start/update/commit shape before either backend may consume the metadata.

PTX applies the same tuple budget and emits `mtlc.tensor_loop resident ...` or
`replay ...`; replay executes the original load/MMA/store semantics, while the
resident path loads C once and delays D until the commit. A libmtlc frontend
gets this result from ordinary builder control flow and tensor descriptors, with no
Mettle-frontend marker exists. `--dump-ir` exposes the neutral residency roles,
and `--explain` reports the legality decision plus the actual PTX/SPIR-V backend
boundary.

The optimizer also recognizes a finite straight-line staged composition:
two or more connected tensor MMAs, with every pair separated by neutral async
completion followed by an acq-rel/seq-cst workgroup publication barrier. It
marks the maximal proved group with pipeline scope and inserts one neutral
commit after the last MMA. Shared verification requires the start, every
update, and commit in one basic block; an ordered WAIT-to-BARRIER handoff at
every transition; no intervening observation of D; identical
descriptor/output/stride connectivity; and only pure scalar work around each
handoff. PTX reports
`mtlc.tensor_pipeline resident ...` or `replay ...`; the resident form carries
the accumulator tuple through wait and barrier. The public builder test creates
the complete copy/tensor pipeline without frontend-private metadata and
receives the same optimization.

The most general form is a region: one start and any number of connected
updates in a single-entry, single-exit stretch of code -- typically a K loop
that stages its tiles through workgroup memory with asynchronous copies,
plain loads and stores, and barriers. Nothing in the region may name D or
reach its memory: every store, asynchronous copy destination, and 4-wide
store must be in a different address space from D, and every load or copy
source must be in a different address space or derive only from other
kernel pointer parameters than D does (the same assumption the loop and
pipeline forms make for MMA operands and copy sources); calls other than
non-atomic intrinsics, returns, launches, and other tensor operations end the
region. The commit goes on its only exit -- control transfers that leave
the region are retargeted to a commit label in front of their destination.
The verifier rebuilds the CFG and rechecks that every block beginning inside
the region is entered only from inside it, that every block ending inside
it leaves only to blocks inside it or to the commit, and the operand rules.
PTX reports `mtlc.tensor_region resident ...` or `replay ...`.

This accepts an arbitrary explicit N-stage sequence within the asynchronous
group contract; it does not hard-code double buffering. The compiler does not
yet generate the tile loop or buffer rotation, unroll an arbitrary MMA
schedule, or model occupancy from assembler feedback. Native
FP8/FP6/MXFP4/NVFP4 selection is implemented, but broader generated scheduling
remains compiler work, not implied by this legality foundation.

Native mixed FP8, dense mixed FP6, scaled MXFP4/NVFP4, and the canonical
structured-2:4 f16/bf16 profile are lowered by PTX without exposing fragments
to the frontend. Other sparse ratios and unsupported type/transpose/shape
combinations remain represented but are rejected with a capability diagnostic.
The current
SPIR-V OpenCL 2.0 profile likewise rejects tensor MMA because it has no enabled
cooperative-matrix capability; adding a newer SPIR-V device profile is separate
backend work, not a frontend redesign.

### Register tiles

A view type whose layout is a fragment layout, declared as a local in a kernel
body, is a register tile: one value the subgroup holds in registers, each work
item its share. Which work item holds which element, and in which register, is
the backend's business, and nothing in the language names a lane, a register
or a vendor instruction.

```mettle
var q: float16[16, 256] layout fragment_a;
var o: float32[16, 256] layout fragment_c = 0.0;
var m: float32[16] layout fragment_c = -1.0e30;
```

| Type | Holds |
|---|---|
| `T[M, K] layout fragment_a` | an MMA A operand, `float16` or `bfloat16`, M a multiple of 16, K of 16 |
| `T[M, N] layout fragment_c` | an accumulator, `float32` or `int32`, or with `bool` a mask; M a multiple of 16, N of 8 |
| `T[M] layout fragment_c` | a row vector: one value per row of an M-row `fragment_c` tile |

A tile has no address. Taking one, indexing `t[r][c]`, passing one to a
function, returning one, or keeping one anywhere but a kernel local is
refused. A declaration without an initializer fills the tile with zero, as an
array is.

Every tile operation is a subgroup collective. One under a branch the subgroup
does not agree on is refused, and so is a scalar operand that differs between
the work items of a subgroup (`thread.x >> 5`, the warp's index, is the same
in all of them; `thread.x` is not).

- `t = scalar` fills. Element-wise math on `fragment_c` tiles and row vectors
  is the ordinary operators, `+ - * /`, comparisons, `&&`, `||`, `!`, and the
  math intrinsics (`expf`, `sqrtf`, `fabsf`, ...), plus `select(c, a, b)`,
  `max(a, b)` and `min(a, b)`. A scalar operand broadcasts to every element
  and a row vector along its rows. `max` and `min` are `max.f32`: a NaN
  operand yields the other, and +0.0 is above -0.0, so any tree of them gives
  the same bits.
- `tile_row(t)` and `tile_col(t)` give each element's row and column as an
  `int32` tile, which is how a mask is written.
- `row_max(t)` and `row_sum(t)` reduce along rows into a row vector. The order
  is part of the operation: the N columns fall into four classes by
  `(column / 2) % 4`, each class is folded left to right from its first
  column, and the classes combine as `(C0 + C1) + (C2 + C3)`. The CPU grid
  runner computes exactly this order, and so must every backend.
- A cast converts. `(float16[16, 32] layout fragment_a)p` turns an f32
  accumulator into the next MMA's A operand in registers. A cast that changes
  layout any other way is refused, naming both layouts.
- `tensor_mma` takes tiles: A may be a `fragment_a` tile, C and D
  `fragment_c` tiles, `c_scale` a row vector, and C may be `0.0`. B stays in
  memory, a pointer or a shaped view whose layout the MMA honors; from
  workgroup memory the backend reads it with `ldmatrix`. The descriptor must
  agree with the tiles' types, and a mismatch names both.
- `tile_load(t, src, ld: e, rows: r)` and `tile_store(dst, t, ld: e, rows: r)`
  move tiles through memory. Rows at or past `r` are not touched, and load as
  zero. An element type that differs from the tile's converts as a cast
  would, so an f32 activation row loads straight into an f16 operand tile.

A shaped view over the dynamic workgroup arena is a cast,
`(uint16 shared[32, 256] layout swizzle128)(s16 + offset)`. The cast is
accepted where the address is proven 16-byte aligned and a row is whole
16-byte groups; its extent inside the arena is the same launch precondition
every dynamic view carries.

Attention's softmax step, from the inference engine's `attention_fr`:

```mettle
var s: float32[16, 32] layout fragment_c;
tensor_mma(qt, kt, 0.0, s, shape: m16n32k256, a_type: f16, b_type: f16,
           accumulator_type: f32, result_type: f32, b_layout: col);
s = s * scale;
var mx: float32[16] layout fragment_c =
    row_max(select(tile_col(s) + keyc <= hi && tile_col(s) + keyc >= lo, s, -1.0e30));
var mn: float32[16] layout fragment_c = max(m, mx);
var alpha: float32[16] layout fragment_c = expf(m - mn);
var p: float32[16, 32] layout fragment_c =
    select(tile_col(s) + keyc <= hi && tile_col(s) + keyc >= lo, expf(s - mn), 0.0);
l = l * alpha + row_sum(p);
m = mn;
var pa: float16[16, 32] layout fragment_a = (float16[16, 32] layout fragment_a)p;
tensor_mma(pa, vt, o, o, shape: m16n256k32, a_type: f16, b_type: f16,
           accumulator_type: f32, result_type: f32, b_layout: row,
           c_scale_mode: per_row, c_scale: alpha);
```

#### Registers

Tiles never spill. The backend states what each tile costs a work item (PTX:
an f32 `fragment_c` M x N tile costs M*N/32 registers, an f16 `fragment_a`
M x K tile M*K/64, a row vector M/8) and compares the peak of the tiles live
at once with the work item's limit: 255, or the multiple of 8 below 65536 /
block threads when that is smaller. Over it, the build fails:

```text
error[G0001]: kernel 'too_many_registers' holds 256 tile registers at line 3,
over its budget of 255 registers a work item; tiles never spill. Live there: a
128, b 128
```

A run of element-wise operations, ending at most in one row reduction, is
emitted one element at a time, so a tile made and used only inside the run
costs nothing. When `ptxas` is on `PATH` the build also assembles the module
and refuses a kernel with tiles that the assembler spilled (`G0002`); without
it the build says the tiles are unconfirmed. `--explain` and
`--report-gpu-types` list every tile:

```text
register tiles
  attention_fr: peak 236 of 255 registers a work item, at line 201
    qt       float16[16,256] layout fragment_a        64 registers, lines 129..217
    o        float32[16,256] layout fragment_c       128 registers, lines 131..222
    ...
    25 of 27 intermediate tiles computed one element at a time, no registers held
```

Element-wise tile arithmetic is emitted with `.rn`, so the assembler does not
fuse it into FMA and what runs is what the program wrote.

#### On the CPU

Under `mettle test` every work item holds the whole tile, and every operation
computes every element in the order the semantics define. The copies should
agree, because the operands are the same in every work item, and the grid
runner checks that they do: the first work item of each subgroup records what
each tile operation wrote and the rest compare, which catches a scalar that
varies by a route the static analysis missed:

```text
the tile written at line 7 differs between work items 0 and 4 of one
subgroup: a scalar it is built from varies
```

The interpreter's arithmetic is the device's except where the device
approximates: `expf` is `ex2.approx` on the device, within 2 ulp.
`tests/gpu/register_tiles.mettle` runs the same kernels on the CPU and, through
the hardware gate, on the GPU, against one reference, bit for bit.

The inference engine's `attention_fr` (16 query rows a warp, eight warps, Q, S,
P and O in tiles) was inline PTX written by a Python generator. In tiles it is
plain Mettle at 255 registers with no spill, where the inline-asm version
spilled 76 bytes, and on the RTX 5060 Ti (`fa256bench`, depths 384 / 896 /
1920) it runs 68.0 / 125.6 / 139.7 us at 128 rows against 77.1 / 144.1 / 157.4,
and 597.2 / 733.2 / 832.6 us at 1024 rows against 641.8 / 787.9 / 888.0.

### Numerics contracts

Kernels that must give the same bits for the same inputs, whatever their tile
shape, warp split or block shape, declare one contract, and the build proves
they do or fails.

```mettle
import "std/numerics";

const Q4_0_GEMM: Numerics = { k_order: k_ascending };

@numerics(Q4_0_GEMM) kernel(block = 256) gemm_q4_0_i8(...) { ... }
@numerics(Q4_0_GEMM) kernel(block = 128) gemm_q4_0_i8_s16(...) { ... }

@numerics(Q4_0_GEMM) fn q4_0_gemm_family() {
  var xq: int8* = (int8*)numerics_input((int64)m * k);
  ...
  dispatch gemm_q4_0_i8[...](...);
  dispatch gemm_q4_0_i8_s16[...](...);
  numerics_same(reference, out, m, d, d);
}
```

A kernel with `@numerics(C)` is a member of C. A plain function with
`@numerics(C)` is a harness: ordinary Mettle that launches members the way the
host does, at the shapes the contract covers, and compares their outputs.
`numerics_input(bytes)` returns memory whose every byte is an input of the
proof; `numerics_same(a, b, rows, cols, ld)` claims two `float32` matrices are
the same bits; `numerics_tensor_map_2d` describes a tensor map to the
interpreter the way `cuTensorMapEncodeTiled` describes it to the device.
Harnesses never reach the binary.

#### The proof

Each harness runs in the compile-time interpreter on the optimized IR the PTX
backend emits from, with every input byte a symbol. Each value is a term and
equal terms are one node, so each output element comes out as its canonical
computation: the ordered chain of rounding operations and where every operand
came from. A claim holds when the two elements are the same node.

- Integer arithmetic is exact. Bitwise operations, whole-byte shifts and
  masks, and stores and loads of any width keep track of bytes, so a value
  stored and reloaded in pieces is the value.
- `f32`/`f64` `+ - * /`, `fma` and `sqrt` round to nearest. Conversions round
  as the cast does.
- `expf` is `ex2.approx` of `x * log2(e)`, and the other approximate
  intrinsics are opaque functions of their operand.
- Each MMA step is opaque: an f16 `m16n8k16` step is a function of the
  accumulator and its row of A and column of B; a block-scaled int8 block is
  the exact integer dot followed by the backend's own rounding sequence.
- A branch whose condition comes from the inputs is followed only when both
  arms just compute values; it becomes a select.

Only identities that are bit-exact are applied, each where its side condition
is proven from facts the check keeps for every term (can it be NaN, infinite,
-0.0): `x * 1.0 = x`, `x + (-0.0) = x`, `x + 0.0 = x` when x cannot be -0.0,
`a + b = b + a`, `a * b = b * a`, `max`/`min` trees in any order, and
constant folding. Every NaN is one value: PTX leaves the bits of a NaN
unspecified.

With `k_order: k_ascending` each tensor accumulation must visit K ascending in
one chain; the check reads the order off each output's chain.

Members emit `f32` `add`, `sub` and `mul` with `.rn`, and so do device
helpers in a module with members, since the PTX ISA lets ptxas fuse unrounded
ones into an FMA and the chain the check derived would then not be the chain
that runs.

The claim covers the shapes the harnesses launch; every other shape is
unproven, and the report (`--explain`) says so. It rests on stated premises:
the PTX backend emits each operation as the instruction its term names, ptxas
keeps the value of `.rn` arithmetic, an MMA step's result for an element
depends only on that element's row of A, column of B and accumulator on every
SM, and the kernels are race-free.

#### Refused

| Code | When |
|---|---|
| `C0001` | two members compute an element differently; the message names the element and the first operation where the chains part, with its line in each kernel: for an MMA step the A or B element that differs, for a sum the same terms added in another order |
| `C0002` | the check cannot decide: a branch, address or loop bound computed from the inputs, inline asm, an extern call, a read of bytes still in flight |
| `C0003` | a member no harness launches, or a harness that claims nothing |
| `C0004` | a member reorders K or splits it into partial sums |

A reordered K walk:

tile_reversed visit the same K steps in different orders for output [0][0] of

```

### Contract-safe tuning

A kernel family whose variants are rows of a table is tuned on the device by
`mettle tune`, and only there: a normal build reads the choice from a checked-in
file and measures nothing. The table sits beside the module, and the module
generates its kernels from the rows the tuning file chose:

```mettle
export struct ShortTile { name: string; m: int32; stages: int32; per: int32; ... }
export const SHORT_TILES: ShortTile[11] = [
  { name: "s16", m: 16, stages: 4, per: 2, ... },
  { name: "s16", m: 16, stages: 8, per: 1, ... },
  ...
];
```

```mettle
import "short_tiles";
import "kernels.tune";

comptime for t in SHORT_TILES_TUNED.rows {
  @numerics(Q4_0_GEMM) kernel(block = t.warps * 32) ident("gemm_q4_0_i8_", t.name)(...) {
    ...
  }
}
```

```bash
mettle tune kernels/kernels.mettle --space SHORT_TILES --key m --check "-O" --build "tools/tune_build.bat" --artifact build/pgemm.exe --run "{artifact} -tune"
```

Each build takes one row for every value of the key. The tuner writes that
choice to `kernels.tune.mettle` and compiles the module with the contract
report. A row the module's numerics contract refuses is reported with its
diagnostic and never built or timed. So is a row whose kernels no contract
proves, since tuning without a proof would choose between results. The proven
builds run `--build`, and copies of `--artifact` run `--run` in interleaved
rounds. The run prints `tune <kernel> <case> <microseconds>` lines, and a row's
time is the sum over its cases of the median across rounds. A key keeps its
shipped row unless a proven row is faster by more than `--margin` percent (1
by default).

The file it writes holds `SHORT_TILES_TUNED`, the chosen row for each key, and
`SHORT_TILES_MEASURED`, every row's verdict and time as `std/tune`
`TuneResult` rows, so the same file always builds the same binary. A build
without the file fails, naming `mettle tune`. Each row needs a `name` column
that ends the names of the kernels it generates, and rows of one key share
it, since the host launches them by name.

```text
m = 16
  row  0    429.05 us    +0.0%  { name: "s16", m: 16, stages: 4, per: 2, ... }  (shipped)  <- chosen
  row  2    426.48 us    -0.6%  { name: "s16", m: 16, stages: 2, per: 2, ... }
  row  3   refused: error[C0004]: contract Q4_0_GEMM accumulates K in one
           ascending chain, and gemm_q4_0_i8_s16 splits it into partial sums
```

### Multidimensional tensor transfers

`tensor_transfer_workgroup` moves one complete rank-1 through rank-5 rectangular
tile between global and workgroup storage. Its source contract contains only
logical extents, byte strides, tile extents, per-dimension element strides,
signed coordinates, zero-fill/discard bounds, element format, direction, and
workgroup scope. Dimension 0 is contiguous and fastest-changing. No CUDA tensor
map, async proxy, transaction barrier, warp, or bank layout appears in source or
shared IR.

An optional `view: uint8*` is an opaque provider acceleration token. The raw
pointer plus logical descriptor remain authoritative: no view or a null view
selects cooperative replay, and a target that cannot preserve the descriptor
must replay or reject. The PTX backend additionally falls back at runtime when
the view is not 64-byte aligned or the workgroup address is not 16-byte aligned.
Valid neutral operations with a
dimension-0 element stride, a sub-16-byte inner TMA box, an encoded box above
256, a stride above 8, or incompatible global geometry never enter the native
path.

For the current NVIDIA provider, a non-null view points to an immutable
`CUtensorMap` in global memory whose address, rank, dimensions, and strides
exactly match the raw operand and descriptor. It uses tiled encoding, no
interleave, no shared-memory swizzle, `boxDim[d] = tile_extent[d] *
element_stride[d]` (with dimension-0 stride equal to one), and the corresponding
element strides. PTX acquires a host-copied map through the tensor-map proxy.
Global-to-workgroup TMA initializes a compiler-owned transaction barrier,
publishes that initialization to the async proxy, issues the tensor copy,
arrives with the expected byte count, waits for phase completion, publishes the
tile, and invalidates the barrier. Workgroup-to-global makes every producer
proxy-fence its own shared writes before the workgroup rendezvous, then the
elected thread issues and drains one bulk group.

Portable PTX replays both directions cooperatively with rank-aware coordinate
unravelling and exact out-of-bounds behavior. The OpenCL 2.0 SPIR-V profile
currently rejects the operation explicitly because its exact cooperative
lowering is not implemented. Native TMA PTX assembles for `sm_121a` with exact
ordering and zero-spill gates, but device execution is quarantined and remains
unqualified; see [the GPU validation tiers](../tests/gpu/README.md). Offline
assembly is not a hardware-safety or correctness claim.

### AI correctness kernels

The real-device suite also expresses numerically stable f32 row softmax and
affine layer normalization directly in Mettle. One subgroup owns each row while
each lane loops over a strided slice, so runtime column counts may exceed the
subgroup width and need not be multiples of it. Both kernels accept independent
padded row strides and use 64-bit address arithmetic. Along with the
multi-output/multi-K-tile and tail-complete tensor/scalar f16/f32 GEMMs above,
they pass CPU numerical oracles on the compute-12.0 development GPU.

These are correctness/expressiveness baselines plus three exact accumulator
residency forms: straight-line chains, a single-update runtime K loop, and
explicit N-stage asynchronous pipelines. They are not claims of general fusion or peak
performance. Bounded-region M/N/K tail selection is now backend-generated for
the documented `tensor_matmul` families; automatic launch-grid/batch tiling,
pipeline rotation, multi-exit and opaque-fragment biased epilogue residency,
attention, general quantized matmul
generation, low-precision scalar types, measurement collection/autotuning, and
GB10 benchmark evidence remain required.

A worked example of the whole path -- kernels, generated declarations, a
checked result, and a captured launch graph -- is
[`examples/gpu_inference/`](../examples/gpu_inference/), which runs one
transformer feed-forward block on the GPU.

### What the four items cost and buy

`tests/gpu/qwen3_typed_kernels.mettle`, and the same file beside the originals
at `examples/llm/qwen3/gpu/kernels_typed.mettle`, holds three of Qwen3's
kernels written twice in one file: once with pointers that say nothing, and once with
the types saying where the memory lives, how the tile is laid out, which values
every work item shares, and which group each collective speaks to. The same
compiler emits both, so the two halves compare directly.

`-O --emit-ptx --gpu-arch=gb10`, PTX instructions per entry:

| Kernel | instr | ld.global.nc | ld.global | ld.shared | st.shared | generic | bra.uni | bra | bar.sync | shfl.sync |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `gemv_plain` | 54 | 0 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 0 | 0 |
| `gemv_typed` | 111 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 3 | 0 | 6 |
| `rmsnorm_plain` | 82 | 0 | 3 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 3 | 0 | 0 |
| `rmsnorm_typed` | 130 | 3 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 4 | 0 | 6 |
| `attn_tile_plain` | 70 | 0 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 0 | 0 |
| `attn_tile_typed` | 115 | 2 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 |

The same modules assembled for `sm_121a` and disassembled, SASS instructions
per entry:

| Kernel | LDG.E.CONSTANT | LDG.E | LDS | STS | BAR.SYNC | SHFL | VOTE | total |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `gemv_plain` | 0 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 48 |
| `gemv_typed` | 14 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 6 | 1 | 176 |
| `rmsnorm_plain` | 0 | 3 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 384 |
| `rmsnorm_typed` | 9 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 6 | 1 | 472 |
| `attn_tile_plain` | 0 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 72 |
| `attn_tile_typed` | 2 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 96 |

Every read-only load in the typed half reaches SASS as `LDG.E.CONSTANT`, the
read-only cache path, and none stays a coherent `LDG.E`. The static count rises
because each typed kernel is one warp per row rather than one work item per
row: the loop it runs is a thirty-second of the plain one's, and its reduction
is six `SHFL` instead of thirty-one serial adds. `ptxas -v` reports the typed
attention tile at 14 registers, one barrier and 4096 bytes of workgroup memory,
against 11 registers and none for the plain one.

The address-space contrast is clearest where a device helper is involved:
`tests/gpu/address_spaces.mettle` and its unspaced twin are the same kernel,
and `--report-gpu-types` says 5 of 5 accesses named their space against 2 of 8,
with three separate loads removed by one `ld.global.v4.f32`.

These are compile-time and assembler numbers. Nothing here was run on a GB10:
see [Known limitations](known-limitations.md#device-types-on-real-hardware).

## Which GPU, and what it gets built for

`mettle --gpu-info` reports what the machine has and which target `--emit-ptx`
would pick, without compiling anything:

```
$ mettle --gpu-info
Mettle GPU target report
  Driver            CUDA 12.9 (cuda-driver)
  Devices           1
  [0] NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060 Ti
      compute capability   12.0  ->  sm_120a
      multiprocessors      36
      warp size            32
      max threads / block  1024
      shared mem / block   48 KiB
      global memory        15.9 GiB
  Assembler         ptxas 12.9 (sm_120a supported)
  Default target    sm_120a, PTX ISA 8.8
```

The answer comes from the CUDA driver itself, loaded on demand: the compiler
links no CUDA library and starts normally on a machine with no NVIDIA driver at
all. Detection settles two things `--emit-ptx` would otherwise have to guess:

- The `.target`. The compute capability the driver reports, taking the
  architecture-specific `sm_NNa` form from compute capability 9.0 onward when
  the installed `ptxas` confirms that form exists.
- The `.version`. A PTX ISA above what the local driver understands fails
  inside `cuModuleLoadData` at run time with nothing but a status code to
  explain it, so the emitted ISA is capped at what this driver can load.

Nothing is detected when no driver answers: the GB10 profile
(`sm_121a`, PTX 8.8) stays the default, which is what makes building on a
laptop for a DGX Spark work. `--gpu-arch=native` asks for the local card by
name and fails rather than falling back, which is what a build that is meant
for this machine wants. Exit status is 0 when a device was found and 1 when
none was, so `mettle --gpu-info` also works as a check in a script.

## Launching from the host

The host is a normal Mettle program. Import `std/gpu`, set up device buffers
explicitly, then launch with `dispatch`:

```mettle
import "std/io";
import "std/mem";
import "std/gpu";

extern kernel(block = 256) vadd(a: float32*, b: float32*, c: float32*, n: int32);

fn main() -> int32 {
  if (gpu_open("kernels.ptx") == 0) { return 1; }

  var n: int32 = 1 << 20;
  var bytes: int64 = (int64)n * 4;
  var ha: float32* = malloc(bytes);
  var hb: float32* = malloc(bytes);
  var hc: float32* = malloc(bytes);
  var i: int32 = 0;
  while (i < n) { ha[i] = (float32)i; hb[i] = (float32)(2 * i); i = i + 1; }

  var da: int64 = gpu_malloc(bytes);
  var db: int64 = gpu_malloc(bytes);
  var dc: int64 = gpu_malloc(bytes);
  gpu_to_device(da, (uint8*)ha, bytes);
  gpu_to_device(db, (uint8*)hb, bytes);

  dispatch vadd[work: n](da, db, dc, n);

  gpu_to_host((uint8*)hc, dc, bytes);
  gpu_free(da); gpu_free(db); gpu_free(dc);
  return 0;
}
```

### Declarations the host cannot get wrong

`dispatch` checks a launch against a host-side `extern kernel` declaration, so
a hand-written declaration is one more thing to keep in step with the kernel.
`--emit-kernel-decls` writes them instead:

```bash
mettle --emit-ptx kernels.mettle -o kernels.ptx \
  --emit-kernel-decls=kernel_decls.mettle
```

```mettle
extern kernel(block = 256) vadd(a: float32*, b: float32*, c: float32*, n: int32);
```

The host imports that file rather than restating it:

```mettle
import "std/gpu";
import "kernel_decls";
```

Every launch is now checked against the kernels as they were actually
compiled, block shape included. Change a kernel's signature, re-emit, and the
host stops compiling until it agrees -- which is the whole point. With no
`=path`, the declarations land beside the PTX as `<output>.mettle`.

### When something goes wrong

The two failures that dominate GPU bring-up are a module that will not compile
and a launch the driver refuses, and both used to arrive as a bare zero or a
bare status code. They now say what happened.

A module that fails to JIT prints the driver's own log, line numbers included:

```
mettle: the GPU module would not load: CUDA_ERROR_INVALID_PTX (a PTX JIT compilation failed)
--- CUDA PTX JIT log ---
ptxas application ptx input, line 5; error   : Not a name of any known instruction: 'bogus'
ptxas fatal   : Ptx assembly aborted due to errors
------------------------
```

A launch the driver rejects names the kernel and the shape it was given:

```
mettle: GPU launch of scale failed with grid 0x1x1, block 256x1x1, 0 shared bytes
  driver status: CUDA_ERROR_INVALID_VALUE (invalid argument)
```

`gpu_module_ex` returns the status instead of reporting it, for a caller that
wants to decide what a failure means; `gpu_jit_log` hands back the last log;
`gpu_error_name` and `gpu_error_text` turn any `CUresult` into words.

### Asking the device about itself

The same facts `--gpu-info` prints at build time are available at run time, so
a server can size its launches to the card it actually landed on:

```mettle
var buffer: uint8[128];
println("{gpu_device_name(0, &buffer[0], 128)}: {gpu_sm_count(0)} SMs");

var blocks: int32 = gpu_sm_count(0) * 4;
dispatch resident[blocks, 256](state, n);
```

`gpu_device_count`, `gpu_sm_count`, `gpu_warp_size`,
`gpu_max_threads_per_block`, `gpu_max_shared_memory_per_block`,
`gpu_compute_capability` (as `major * 10 + minor`), `gpu_total_memory`,
`gpu_is_integrated`, and `gpu_driver_version` cover the rest. `gpu_init_on`
and `gpu_open_on` take a device ordinal for a process that owns more than one
card.

### The `dispatch` statement

```
dispatch KERNEL[grid, block](arg0, arg1, ...);

dispatch KERNEL[
  grid: (grid_x, grid_y, grid_z),
  block: (block_x, block_y, block_z),
  shared: dynamic_shared_bytes,
  stream: stream_handle
](arg0, arg1, ...);
```

- `KERNEL` is either the name of a host-side `extern kernel` declaration, in
  which case the arguments and the block shape are checked at compile time and
  the handle is resolved by name, or a raw handle (the `int64` returned by
  `gpu_func`), in which case nothing is checked.
- The compact form supplies one integer grid and block dimension; the other
  axes are one and dynamic shared bytes/stream are zero.
- The named form requires exactly three integer dimensions in both `grid` and
  `block`. `shared` and `stream` are optional, default to zero, and named
  controls may be reordered. Every statically known dimension must be positive;
  shared bytes are an integer and a stream is an integer or pointer handle.
- The arguments are passed by value. Device pointers are `int64` handles; scalars
  (`int32`, `float32`, ...) are forwarded with their natural width.

`dispatch` becomes a typed, target-neutral launch operation in IR. Only host
lowering marshals the argument cells and calls the stable
`mtlc_gpu_launch_checked` runtime-provider ABI. The bundled CUDA provider maps
that ABI to `cuLaunchKernel`; another frontend uses `mtlc_gpu_launch` to build
the same operation without depending on Mettle syntax. A failed enqueue is not
silently discarded: the checked statement contract names the kernel, the grid
and block it was given, and the driver's status, then terminates. Use
`gpu_launch_3d` directly when code needs to inspect and recover from the
returned status. Allocation and copies remain explicit.

For explicit concurrency, `std/gpu` also exposes nonblocking streams, events,
asynchronous copies, stream-ordered allocation/free, managed memory, and
`gpu_launch_3d` / `gpu_launch_on`. Those are runtime foundations; they do not
yet constitute a hardware-validated scheduler or graph implementation.

## Building

```bash
# 0. see what this machine has, and what step 1 will target
mettle --gpu-info

# 1. compile optimized kernels for the local GPU (auto-detected via the
#    driver; falls back to the DGX Spark GB10 profile when no GPU is visible)
mettle -O --emit-ptx kernels.mettle -o kernels.ptx

# The same, but refuse to build at all if this machine has no GPU:
mettle -O --emit-ptx --gpu-arch=native kernels.mettle -o kernels.ptx

# Or pin a profile explicitly, for example DGX Spark GB10:
mettle -O --emit-ptx --gpu-arch=gb10 kernels.mettle -o kernels.ptx

# A forward-compatible development baseline is also available:
mettle -O --emit-ptx --gpu-arch=portable kernels.mettle -o kernels.ptx

# 2. build the host, linking the CUDA driver import stub (build-time only)
mettle --build host.mettle -o host.exe \
  --link-arg "<CUDA>/lib/x64/cuda.lib"        # Windows x86-64
```

The host links `nvcuda`, the OS driver, as an explicit vendor API. There is no
bundled CUDA DLL. At run time the driver JITs
the PTX to SASS for the installed GPU.

### Reporting and check flags

| Flag | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `--gpu-info` | Reports the local GPUs, the driver, `ptxas`, and the target `--emit-ptx` would pick. Takes no input file |
| `--emit-kernel-decls[=F]` | With `--emit-ptx`, also writes each kernel's host-side `extern kernel` declaration, so an importing host cannot drift from the module it launches |
| `--report-launches` | Lists every dispatch site with the grid and block the compiler can fold, and the kernel each one names |
| `--report-occupancy` | With `--emit-ptx`, runs `ptxas -v` on the emitted module and prints each kernel's registers per thread and the occupancy ceiling they imply |
| `--sms=N` | SM count used for the whole-card fill thresholds in that report. Defaults to asking the local driver, and the thresholds are omitted when no driver answers |
| `--gpu-checks` | Emits the trap for each kernel-side `gpu_assert`. Without it those assertions cost nothing |

`--report-occupancy` needs `ptxas` on `PATH`, since it reads that tool's own
register and spill accounting.

GPU `-O` is intentionally backend-agnostic. It runs shared scalar/CFG
transformations only over kernel-reachable device functions and retains
address spaces, memory order/scope, barriers, subgroup collectives, and tensor
descriptors as semantic IR. It may combine an exact straight-line tensor
accumulation into a neutral chain or license the exact verified loop-carried
residency region described above; backend selection remains separate. The x86
SIMD/idiom pipeline and ML optimizer are not allowed to shape PTX or SPIR-V
modules.

On DGX Spark, build and run the Mettle compiler natively. Ordinary compile and
`--build` commands emit and link AArch64 ELF64 objects. AAPCS64 external calls,
global and string addresses, owned runtime linkage, and the eleven argument
`cuLaunchKernel` call shape are CI-gated on native Arm. `--emit-arm64` remains a
separate self-contained smoke executable for bring-up, while
`mtlc_emit(MTLC_ARCH_ARM64)` is the relocatable cross-host product.

The repository CI uses a hardware-free CUDA-shaped provider to validate the
complete host call ABI. Real driver loading, PTX JIT, launch, and result checks
remain part of the DGX acceptance suite because generic Arm runners do not have
GB10 hardware or `libcuda`.

Build the compiler itself for the Spark CPU with
`make DGX_SPARK=1`; with GCC 15 or LLVM 21, prefer
`make DGX_SPARK=1 DGX_SPARK_CFLAGS=-mcpu=gb10`.

Before treating a build as a Spark release, run the strict native gate:

```bash
bash tests/gpu/run_hardware_tests.sh --require-gb10 --sanitizer
```

It compiles optimized kernels, executes CPU-oracle comparisons through the
CUDA Driver, then runs compute-sanitizer memcheck and racecheck. Strict mode
refuses to pass unless the harness itself is AArch64 and CUDA reports an
integrated compute-12.1 device. The exact cases and non-claims are documented
in [`tests/gpu/README.md`](../tests/gpu/README.md).

The strict release gate intentionally excludes experimental TMA. Its separate
three-way opt-in is documented with the recovery requirements in that
validation guide; do not enable it on a workstation.

## Profiling Mettle kernels

### Nsight Systems

```bat
nsys profile --trace=cuda -o run app.exe
nsys stats --report cuda_gpu_kern_sum,cuda_api_sum run.nsys-rep
```

The timeline shows every kernel launch, memcpy and driver call, the same as
for a CUDA program. Nothing in the program needs changing.

Programs built before this fix recorded nothing: no kernels and no API calls,
and the report said "No CUDA events collected". Nsight's injection library
raises and handles exceptions of its own while it sets up CUDA tracing. The
Mettle crash reporter installs a first-chance (vectored) exception handler,
and it used to treat every exception as a crash of the program and end the
process, so the process died there with no report, before the first CUDA call
was traced. The handler now acts only on exceptions raised inside the Mettle
executable. Anything raised in a DLL goes through normal dispatch, and a fault
nothing handles still reaches the crash report through the unhandled-exception
filter. Rebuild an older executable, or link it with `--no-crash-report`, to
profile it.

### Nsight Compute

```bat
ncu --metrics gpu__time_duration.sum app.exe
ncu -k vadd --set full -o report app.exe
```

`-k` limits profiling to one kernel; `-o` writes a report for the Nsight
Compute UI.

On Windows with a locale whose decimal separator is a comma (en-ZA, de-DE, and
others), ncu's command-line printer fails with `==ERROR== Failed to start the
profiler: bad conversion` whenever it prints metrics in base units or prints a
section: any `--section`, the default set, `--csv` (which implies
`--print-units base`), `--print-units base`, and `--import` of a saved report.
Setting `LC_ALL` or `LANG` does not help. What does work (verified with ncu
2025.2.1 under en-ZA):

- A metric printed in automatic units: `ncu --metrics gpu__time_duration.sum
  app.exe` prints `22,34 us`, and `--csv --print-units auto` gives CSV.
- Collecting sections into a report: `ncu -o report app.exe` succeeds; read it
  with the Python report interface, which returns numbers rather than text:

  ```python
  import sys
  sys.path.append(r"C:\Program Files\NVIDIA Corporation\Nsight Compute 2025.2.1\extras\python")
  import ncu_report
  report = ncu_report.load_report("report.ncu-rep")
  action = report.range_by_idx(0).action_by_idx(0)
  print(action.name(), action.metric_by_name("gpu__time_duration.sum").as_double())
  ```

Setting Windows' decimal symbol to `.` (Region, Additional settings) should
also avoid the failure, but that changes the setting for every program and was
not tested here.

## SPIR-V (OpenCL) target

The same kernels compile to SPIR-V with `--emit-spirv`, targeting the
OpenCL 2.0 execution environment (Physical64 addressing, the `Kernel`
capability, the OpenCL memory model). This is the flavor that fits Mettle's
kernel ABI unchanged: kernels take raw typed pointers and do pointer arithmetic
plus loads/stores, which is the OpenCL/CUDA model, not the Vulkan
descriptor-buffer model.

```bash
mettle --emit-spirv kernels.mettle -o kernels.spv
```

The output is a binary SPIR-V module (one `OpEntryPoint ... Kernel` per kernel)
that an OpenCL runtime consumes with `clCreateProgramWithIL`. The same source
constructs as the PTX path are supported: arithmetic, comparisons, `if`/`while`
(including `&&`/`||` and nesting), pointer indexing, casts, the `gpu_*` index
built-ins (mapped to the OpenCL work-item built-ins, so `thread` reads
`LocalInvocationId`, `block` reads `WorkgroupId`, `block_dim` reads
`WorkgroupSize`, and `grid_dim` reads `NumWorkgroups`), static workgroup/private
arrays, launch-sized workgroup views, explicit `barrier(...)` (an
`OpControlBarrier`), the f32 math intrinsics
(an `OpExtInst` from `OpenCL.std`),
`h2f`/`f2h`, the unsigned u32/u64 atomic load/store/RMW/CAS family, and the portable subgroup subset above. SPIR-V
subgroup modules require the OpenCL `cl_khr_subgroups` device extension.
Modules using u64 atomics declare `Int64Atomics` and require both
`cl_khr_int64_base_atomics` and `cl_khr_int64_extended_atomics`; u32-only
modules remain valid against the mandatory OpenCL 2.0 capability set.
The current OpenCL 2.0 profile does not enable a cooperative-matrix extension,
so it rejects `tensor_mma` explicitly rather than scalarizing it invisibly.

libmtlc frontends can make pointer address spaces and atomic order/scope
explicit with `mtlc_type_pointer_in`, `mtlc_intrinsic_memory`, and
`mtlc_atomic_compare_exchange`. PTX preserves
global/workgroup/generic spaces and scoped C/C++ atomic ordering (including the
specified sequentially-consistent fence sequence); SPIR-V emits the matching
OpenCL storage class, Scope, ordering, and memory-class bits. Mettle source now
exposes static workgroup/private storage, launch-sized workgroup views,
configurable workgroup barriers, and native type-directed atomics without
extern declarations. The operations are load, store, fetch
add/sub/min/max/and/or/xor, exchange, and compare-exchange for uint32/uint64;
named options select address space, order, failure order, and scope.

Control flow maps directly onto SPIR-V basic blocks (`OpBranch` /
`OpBranchConditional`), exactly as the PTX path maps it onto `bra`. SPIR-V's
structured-control-flow rules (`OpSelectionMerge`/`OpLoopMerge`) are mandated
only by the `Shader` capability, so `Kernel` (OpenCL) modules may branch freely,
which `spirv-val --target-env opencl2.0` confirms.

## Metal (Apple GPU) target

`--emit-metal` compiles the same kernels to Metal Shading Language source for
Apple GPUs. The Metal runtime compiles that source when a host program loads
it (`newLibraryWithSource`), the way the CUDA driver compiles PTX.

```bash
mettle -O --emit-metal kernels.mettle -o kernels.metal
mettle -O --emit-metal --metal-version=4.1 kernels.mettle -o kernels.metal
```

`--metal-version` takes 3.1, 3.2 (the default, macOS 15), 4.0 or 4.1.
`--metal-fast-math` lets Metal reassociate and contract float arithmetic. By
default the module starts with `#pragma METAL fp math_mode(safe)` and
`fp contract(off)`, and the math built-ins call the `precise::` forms, so
`sqrtf` is correctly rounded. `--gpu-checks` turns a failed `gpu_assert` into
a fault in Metal's log.

### What a kernel becomes

Every kernel parameter goes into one argument struct at `buffer(0)`, laid out
the way the CUDA parameter buffer is: each field at its natural alignment,
pointers as 64-bit GPU addresses (`MTLBuffer.gpuAddress` plus an offset),
records as their own bytes. The host makes every allocation resident before a
dispatch. The launch-sized workgroup arena is `threadgroup(0)`, sized with
`setThreadgroupMemoryLength`. `kernel(block = N)` becomes
`[[max_total_threads_per_threadgroup(N)]]`.

| Mettle | Metal |
|---|---|
| `thread`, `block`, `block_dim`, `grid_dim` | `thread_position_in_threadgroup`, `threadgroup_position_in_grid`, `threads_per_threadgroup`, `threadgroups_per_grid` |
| `subgroup_local_id()`, `subgroup_size()` | `thread_index_in_simdgroup`, `threads_per_simdgroup` |
| `workgroup` / `private` arrays | `threadgroup` / `thread` arrays |
| `barrier(workgroup, ...)` | `threadgroup_barrier` with the matching memory flags |
| subgroup broadcast, reductions, scans, ballot, any, all | `simd_broadcast`, `simd_sum`, `simd_min`, `simd_max`, `simd_prefix_*_sum`, `simd_ballot`, `simd_any`, `simd_all` |
| `subgroup_shuffle` | `simd_shuffle`; an inactive or out-of-range source lane returns the caller's value |
| uint32 atomics | `atomic_uint`; ordered forms use `atomic_thread_fence` on Metal 3.2 and native orders on 4.1 |
| `async_copy_workgroup` | ordinary copies, in order |
| `tensor_mma` with f16, bf16 or f32 inputs | `simdgroup_matrix` 8x8 tiles |
| block-scaled int8 x int8/int4 `tensor_mma` | exact integer dot products in scalar code, the CPU grid runner's rounding sequence |
| `gpu_print`, `gpu_print_i32`, ... | `os_log_default.log`, Metal 3.2 |

Metal has no `goto`, so the compiler rebuilds structured `if`, `while` and
`switch` blocks from the kernel's control flow; ordinary loops and branches
come back as written.

### What Metal does not have

Each of these is refused with a message naming the kernel and the line:

- `float64`. Apple GPUs have no double. A fractional literal like `0.5` is
  float64, so `x * 0.5` with `x: float32` computes in float64. When every
  operand is a float32 value or a literal float32 holds exactly, and the
  result is only rounded back to float32, the compiler computes it in float32
  and gets the same bits. A compare of a float32 against a float64 literal is
  rewritten exactly too. Anything else is refused; write `(float32)0.1`.
- 64-bit atomic read-modify-write. Metal has only `atomic_max`/`atomic_min`
  on `atomic_ulong`, and they return nothing.
- Inline PTX, transaction barriers and tensor maps (`mbarrier_*`,
  `tma_load_2d`).
- `tensor_matmul`, `tensor_epilogue`, `tensor_transfer`, register tiles, and
  `tensor_mma` in FP8/FP6/FP4, sparse or TF32 form.
- A pointer that holds workgroup memory on one path and device memory on
  another. Metal has no generic address space; a helper that takes a plain
  `T*` is compiled once per address space it is called with.

### Launching on Metal

On macOS, `std/gpu` runs launches through Metal. The host program is the same
one that drives CUDA: `gpu_open` loads the `.metal` file that `--emit-metal`
wrote, `gpu_malloc` returns a 64-bit GPU address, `gpu_to_device` and
`gpu_to_host` copy through the buffer's shared storage, and `dispatch` checks
each launch against the `extern kernel` declarations from
`--emit-kernel-decls`.

```bash
mettle -O --emit-metal kernels.mettle -o kernels.metal \
  --emit-kernel-decls=kernel_decls.mettle
mettle -O --build host.mettle -o host
```

`--gpu-provider=metal` picks the Metal provider on another host, which is how
the tests run it against the interpreter. Launches collect in one command
buffer, with a buffer barrier between dispatches, and the buffer commits when
the host next touches device memory: a copy, a free, `gpu_sync`, an event
record, every 512 launches, and at exit. An error in a batch names its first
and last kernel; `METTLE_METAL_SYNC=1` waits after every launch to find the
one that failed. Streams are one ordered queue, and events record host time
after waiting. Graph capture records the packed launches, and a replay encodes
them all into the current command buffer. Metal has one GPU per process and
no managed memory (`gpu_managed_malloc` returns null). `gpu_open_kernels(stem)`
loads `stem.ptx` under CUDA and `stem.metal` under Metal, so one host program
serves both.

A launch needs each argument's size and alignment to build the argument
struct. `dispatch` appends them to the parameter table it passes the
provider: `nargs` pointers to argument cells, then `nargs` words of
`alignment << 24 | size`. The CUDA provider reads only the pointers. A
hand-built table for `gpu_launch` on Metal needs the second half too.

### Testing without a Mac

`tests/metal/metal_harness.c` runs 25 contracts with CPU oracles. On Windows
and Linux it executes the emitted MSL in `tests/metal/msl_interp.c`, a strict
interpreter that also refuses anything MSL leaves undefined (signed overflow,
oversized shifts, misaligned or out-of-bounds access).
`tests/metal/metal_host_main.mettle` is a Mettle host program built with
`--gpu-provider=metal` and linked with `src/runtime/metal_runtime.c` and
`tests/metal/metal_provider_interp.c`, a provider that runs the interpreter in
place of a GPU. It checks scalar, record and pointer argument packing, 2-D
grids, and the dynamic workgroup arena end to end. Built on macOS with
`-DMETAL_HARNESS_NATIVE -framework Metal -framework Foundation -lobjc`, the
same contracts run on the GPU. When Apple's Metal compiler is installed
(`METTLE_METAL_COMPILER`, `xcrun`, or `metal` on PATH), the suite compiles
every emitted file with it.

## Notes and limits

- Without `--gpu-arch`, the CLI targets the local GPU: it asks the CUDA
  driver for the device's compute capability, falling back to `nvidia-smi`
  when the driver library is out of reach, and selects the matching
  `sm_NN` target, using the architecture-specific `a` variant from `sm_90`
  onward so the full tensor instruction surface is available. When no GPU or
  driver is visible (headless or cross-compiling hosts), the default is
  `.version 8.8` / `.target sm_121a` for GB10. `--gpu-arch` always wins:
  `portable` emits PTX 6.4 / `compute_75`; raw `sm_NN` and `compute_NN`
  targets plus `--ptx-version=M.m` are available for integration.
- `dispatch` is a checked enqueue: provider failure terminates the process.
  Status-returning `gpu_launch_3d` remains available when recovery is required.
  Provider-neutral launch attributes beyond geometry, dynamic shared bytes, and
  stream are not represented yet.
- Kernels and host code live in separate files (the kernel file is compiled
  with `--emit-ptx`; the host with `--build`).
- A record kernel parameter is passed by value. The OpenCL 2.0 SPIR-V profile
  rejects by-value record parameters and results; pass a pointer there.
